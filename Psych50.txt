A good class for gaining a solid grounding cognitive neuroscience, if you are interested in the subject. The lectures can get a bit dry, but the material is interesting and the sections help to keep the topics relevant. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
be prepared for not the most interesting lecture and to teach yourself a decent amount of material if you have no neuroscience background 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
definitely need to put in a lot of work! a lot of the concepts are tough but its all super interesting 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Definitely take it. Labs were awesome!! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Definitely, reccommend taking the course. It is challenging to keep up with all of the complex concepts, but Justin was such a great instructor, and he provided very nice lecture slides and weekly study guides. There are also a lot of very helpful TAs. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Do it if you are interested in neuroscience. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Don't recommend. Terrible instruction. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Don't slack off just because the majority of the class is open note or else you will be very overwhelmed during the final 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Don't take it unless you have to for your major / are extremely interested in cogsci. Really a poor class 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
extremely interesting, learned so much stuff, good intro to neuroscience 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Fascinating course! Great overview of all kinds of neuroscience topics, and I'd recommend it even if you're not a Psych major or taking it for a WAYS requirement. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
fun class 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Gardner’s slides are trash. It’s easy to not know what’s happening till the very end. Would not recommend 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
get into dan's section! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Given the class is 4 units, the amount of assignments is a bit much. The sections do not always seem to correlate with the material taught in the lecture and in the book. The quality of teaching varies greatly between sections. If taught by solely undergraduates, the section tends to feel very unorganized and section goals are never really highlighted so it's difficult to understand the point of the section. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Go to lectures and take detailed notes. They'll help on the thought questions and help you remember the material. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Good course, lots of vocsb 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Good course. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
great course. Huge amount of information. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Great course; you learn a ton! Spend time on thought questions as they are very useful and try to keep up with readings. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Having taken other neuroscience classes beforehand (including the neuroscience part of the HumBio core) I was a little disappointed with this class. It touches on so many topics that you never feel like you're diving in depth into anything. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I am a psych major and I thought this class was super hard. I try to understand and the stuff can be interesting it's just so specific and hard to relate it to actual things that matter. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I definitely did the bare minimum, and paid for it. Even though it's easy to slide by in this course, the information is super interesting and the instruction is excellent. You're going to have to learn it for the final anyway, so you might as well pay attention in class and actually do the readings. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I encourage all majors to take this class. The first week is very dense, but the material gets slightly easier and more enjoyable as you progress, so don't drop if you're lost a week in, just go to office hours. Study before the midterm, even if it is open book. The open book midterm was the hardest exam I've taken at Stanford, despite it being available for 36 hours. The closed book final was substantially easier comparatively. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I learned so much from it. It is definitely a difficult class, but it is incredibly fascinating! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I really enjoyed this class, especially the section meetings. We did several hands-on experiments that really helped me understand the concepts taught in lecture, like stimulating a cockroach leg with action potentials from music or dissecting a sheep brain. Justin was not the most engaging lecturer, but I still got a lot out of the class. Study guides are really helpful. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I think it was fine. Not super mindblowing but also not awful. Work tends to be mostly busywork. I used this to fulfill a requirement for symsys, and I think this was fine for that. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I think it would have been nice to have used the study guides every week rather than realizing that they were important and using them for the final. Like just start a doc the first week and fill in what you can that weekend. That way when the final comes around you're not searching for the core content of the course, you can focus on what you weren't able to fill in. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
I think psych 50 is a great course! There's a lot of interesting material and especially quite a bit of biology, but its explained really well. It's important to go over the material at the end of each week to make sure you understand everything. I recommended making a chart of "add, remove, observe" experiments as you go. Thanks Justin! Also the Eagleman guest lecture is so cool! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
idk man. read my previous comment. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
If you're not interested in the biological side of psychology, this class isn't for you. I found this class boring, not intellectually challenging, and conceptually dull. I didn't actively dislike it, however, because it was barely any work other than the take-home midterm which took basically an entire day. We get "study guides" every week, which sound good in theory, but are 100% useless, make no sense, and are littered with poor grammar. It's an easy way to get some WAYS requirements out of the way, but it's not very intellectually stimulating if you're not actively interested in cognitive neuroscience. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
interesting concepts 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It is a great course! Although it covers A LOT, it is definitely worthwhile to take it. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It is very interesting 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It isn't the greatest psych class. If you aren't taking this class for a major requirement and are just looking for a fun class to maybe fulfill a WAYS, I would suggest taking something else. You don't learn a ton and the lectures could be a lot more interesting. The subject matter is really cool, but the lectures are pretty dry and boring. I would suggest taking Psych 30 or 45 instead. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It was a good introduction to cognitive neuroscience. Most of the concepts are fairly abstract, but Professor Gardner did a good job of trying to explain them. The study guides were also helpful. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a great introduction to neuroscience. If you're curious about the brain, take it! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a lot of fun, go to the lectures (make sure to get a coffee beforehand). Stay steady on the readings and concepts weekly to avoid getting trashed by the midterm and final 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a lot of new material but it's very interesting. Be prepared to do a lot of work as well -- a midterm, a final, weekly thought questions, weekly quizzes, and even a poster just for one class is a LOT. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a lot of work for a 4 unit class and is very biology heavy as opposed to psych heavy. Only take it if you have to or if you have a strong interest in neuroscience. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's an interesting course but I wish the professor did a better job explaining some things 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's hard to focus during lecture, do the readings and go through the study guides to understand content well. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's helpful to have some background in biology or chemistry for sure. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's pretty poorly taught and poorly organized, but the content is interesting if you can get past that. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Just look at the study guides. The textbook isn't useful. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Justin has great study guides every week that are extremely useful. Going to class really helps with reinforcing the things that are on there, and the sections are generally pretty fun. If you like the more technical parts of psychology or neuroscience, I definitely recommend. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Keep up with the readings and lectures, ask questions if you don't understand. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Kind of dry and the lectures weren't the most helpful or in-depth 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
lecture can be a bit boring because it is easy to tune out Justin sometimes, but most of the topics covered are in fact interesting. if you are interested in neuroscience, then take it! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Lecture slides are difficult to follow so go to class 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Lots of interesting ideas around neuroscience and good survey course, but don't get to learn a lot about any one topic. Professor clearly cares a lot about his teaching. Sections are helpful. Feels a bit like a middle school science class though. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Lots of material, but be sure to focus more on the broad concepts. Don't get too tied up in small anatomical details, and definitely get help if you don't understand things early on! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Material taught is great but could be taught better 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
not the best organization, lectures can be hard to follow 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Only take this class if you absolutely have to. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Only take this if this is a requirement for your major. If you are interesting in psychology, either take PSYCH 1 or work in a neuroscience/cognitive science lab: you learn the same material and in a more effective manner. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Probably the best class I have had so far. The material is so engaging, professor Gardner and all TAs are really committed to improving the class and understanding. It is not an easy class, but I genuinely enjoyed every single lecture and section. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Psych 50 is more difficult than other introductory psych courses, but it's one of the most interesting and rewarding to take. Definitely recommended!
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Sometimes the material is confusing and dense and the professor will skip over it, so make sure to follow up with your TA's. Also, go to lecture because the lecture slides aren't very helpful. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
SUPER interesting; highly recommend 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it definitely, one of the best classes I've ever taken 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it! It makes me start to think about majoring in Psych Cog-Sci track (I was only into social psych before) 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it! Justin is a great lecturer and for an introductory class you actually learn a lot of material. The sections are very helpful and the TAs clearly put a lot of effort into making the content engaging and informative. Another bonus: the class is not too much work. Stanford doesn't have that many cogsci/neurosci classes for undergraduates but this one is great 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it! This class is so interesting, and the instruction is great. We get to do cool things like listen to action potentials in cockroach legs and dissect sheep brains! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take notes during the lectures because the slides aren't intuitive. the study guides have all the stuff you need to know 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The class is an excellent introduction to cognitive neuroscience. If you're at all interested in the brain, I recommend it 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The class isnt too bad! Take it if you like learning a bit about the brain 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The concepts are interesting, but the instruction is so-so. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The content is really interesting, but the tests are disorganized. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The course is very detail-oriented. Justin is very monotone in lecture, which makes it really hard to concentrate. His slides don't make sense, and his study guides aren't even grammatically correct half of the time. I would only recommend taking it if it's a required course for your major. Otherwise, you might as well find some other psych class to take. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
the info is really cool, study guides are helpful 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The lectures were not incredibly interesting, especially if you have a background in psychology, but going to them is the best way to stay on top of the material. The lecture slides posted afterwards are sometimes hard to read and you don't learn about the set up for many experiments. I also wasn't a huge fan of the content, but if you think you might be interested in neuroscience, definitely take it! The quizzes and thought questions were very easy, but the midterm and final exams were very hard! Review the study guides, quizzes, thought questions, and practice tests! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The material is very interesting but the lectures are extremely, painfully slow and the reading does not go into a ton of depth. Left me wanting more thorough, in depth knowledge in every subject we covered. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The section leaders make it a good course. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The take-home midterm will take longer than they tell you. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
The topics this course covers are fascinating, and I feel, perhaps, everyone should take it. It introduces you to so many concepts that will seem like "illuminating fundamental truths about our existence". I don't know how good lectures are because I didn't go once, but the sections are amazing and extremely engaging. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class has a good amount of content for an introduction-level course but is organized in such a way that it was more manageable than I anticipated and I ended up enjoying how much I had learned and understood from this class. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is really interesting. I don't have much background in this and struggled to really grasp some of these concepts. I would recommend office hours to get more concrete help. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class was kind of a mess. Justin's lectures would be interesting but I'd leave every week very confused on what I was supposed to know, his study guides would have 50 terms but I would leave lecture knowing none of them and genuinely confused. The only thing that slightly helped was section, but only with larger conceptual topics. The fact that the midterm was take home was nice but the final was awful since everyone was brutally confused on what we had to know and what was expected. Go into Guillaume's section if he's TAing— only thing that made this class somewhat tolerable. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course has a bad reputation... but don't believe it! The lectures aren't phenomenal... but the class as a whole is great. TAs are wonderful, content is great, homework is pretty sparse. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course is a lot of fun! It explores many of the underlying functions we often take for granted. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course is incredibly interesting, but requires a lot of work and a serious time commitment. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course is very heavy in terminology and can honestly sometimes be a little dry. Guest lectures were fascinating. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is a great class to take. The material is extremely interesting. The assignments are valuable as they help you have deeper understandings of the content. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is a great intro to cognitive neuroscience course 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is a really interesting and pretty well taught class. The workload is light. Weekly quizzes (that you can take twice), thought questions, and readings (which you don't really need to do). The lectures are clear, but a bit long. The notes are very helpful and sections are chill and good for reinforcing the main concepts. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
This was a super interesting class. It was a bit difficult to adjust to Prof Gardner's lecture style just because his slides are unique, but once I got used to it I found then adequate. The sections are generally interesting and help increase your understanding. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
very informationally dense 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Very interesting course, just keep up with the reading and get Dan as your TA. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Will make you more knowledgeable in the areas of cognitive neuroscience, instruction got a little dry, but overall good class 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
Wonderfull Professor and Wonderful learnings 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
You just need to bullshit a lot in this class. If you can synthesize concepts in a way that sounds smart, then you are good to go!! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
You learn some cool models for how the brain works. Not too much work, but the more you put in the more you get out. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
You learn some many interesting things about emerging research, current knowledge, and methods of experimenting that all add up to a great understanding of the human brain. If you're at all interested in neuroscience that you'll love this class. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
You will need to spend time with the material yourself. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2017/2018, Winter)
-Fascinating. The teaching team does a great job of exposing you to several major areas of research within cognitive neuroscience, and tying everything together so that you not only know facts, but have an understanding of how scientists go about researching big questions in neuroscience -The readings are interesting, and lecture material is also very interesting 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Although the lectures can be a bit boring, the material is very interesting and the study guides are extremely helpful. Take it if you are interested in what the field of neuroscience entails 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
An interesting class. Worth taking if you're interested in how the brain works and how that relates to human behavior. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
An interesting introduction to the area of cognitive neuroscience - you won't get a base of learning for everything there is to know, but a lot of interesting topics are covered well in this course. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Awesome class with very organized, clear instruction. Material is extremely interesting. Would absolutely recommend. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Choose your TA wisely, lecture isn't great 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Do it for your SMA if you want to learn about neuro. No need to go to lecture 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Do not slack off in this class! It is very, very doable if you do the work assigned to you. Devote one hour or less to each assigned reading, devote one hour to each thought question, go to lecture/section and you wont need to do much work other than that. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Do not, I repeat, do not take this class. Unless you have a big interest in technical biology/anatomy, and unless you have a penchant for memorizing and internalizing insane amounts of information, do not take this class. Professor Gardner is, simply put, a disgrace: he puts no effort in making the class engaging, and the massive study guides that he puts out every week in an outwardly magnanimous attempt to summarize the important information into 20 pages or so turns out entirely useless in the face of the massively convoluted, entirely unsolvable trick questions on the exams. This is one of the worst, if not the worst, class I have taken at Stanford. Do not repeat my mistake, and take something else if you are trying to fulfill a major/minor or SMA requirement. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
don't 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Extremely well taught and well organized. A great class to take for interest or for WAYS, as well as major elective 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Good intro class and not too much work. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Great class, well structured. Go for it. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Great course! Would highly recommend if you're interested in understanding the connection between brain and behavior. Really cool to think about how our everyday experience translates into neurons firing in the brain. The study guides are super helpful--use them! It's worth spending a good amount of time on the Thought Questions--gets you to solidify your understanding of key concepts or realize where you're still confused. Also good prep for the midterm & final. Professor Gardner and the TAs are really responsive to questions. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Great course, highly recommend 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
I am not a psychology or humbio major, so this course was pretty hard for me, but you learn a lot. You really have to keep up with the readings and assignments, because the new material relies heavily on understanding the older material. This is not a class where you can skip lectures! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
I did not find the lectures valuable, but all of the readings were very good and informative. You can learn everything from the materials provided (book, study guides, etc.) 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
I would highly recommend it especially if they are interested in cognitive neuroscience. It is a very organized course and by just doing the work, you will learn a lot. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
I would highly recommend this class! Do the readings, but use them as more of a background. Don't worry about memorizing everything in the book. Go over the study guides. These are an extremely helpful tool that will allow you to do well on the tests. Also read over the thought question examples to be sure you understand what they are looking for when they ask the thought questions, as these are a large part of the test. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
I would recommend it. It is interesting and well organized. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
I would recommend taking Psych 1 first to have a stronger background coming in 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
If you can stay awake in lecture, then go. If not -- don't waste your time and just do the reading and the practice exams. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It can be challenging at times and a bit work-heavy, but the quizzes and thought question assignments reinforce the knowledge you gain. They also help you more deeply understand it and prepare you for exams. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It has really interesting material. I actually enjoyed reading the textbook. The TAs are all awesome and Justin is cool, albeit a little timid/dry in lecture. The class doesn't take up much time, just try to stay on top of the readings. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It is an entry course with a lot of material in common with Psych 1. The teaching staff insist on holding your hand through the material far more than is necessary. Additionally, the teaching staff repeatedly introduces material as if it is more scientifically sound than it actually is. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It is tough but super interesting. You have to read the textbook or lecture does not make any sense 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It was great as a sysmys major to take this class because it filled in a lot of gaps in my former coursework 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's a good foundational course if you're interested in neuroscience. The course staff really cares and tries to make lecture and section interesting. Each individual topic covered is well-organized, although the links between topics are not always clear. (One week we may discuss emotion and the next jump to memory.) 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's a good overview of cogneuro, a bit disjointed and jumps around between subject matters. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's a really cool course that I'd recommend for anyone interested in this sort of subject. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's awesome and interesting just do it but also readings are so important 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's intense, but you will learn a ton and you will feel very supported by the teaching staff. There's a lot of assignments each week, but they're all fairly short, manageable, and clearly designed to maximize learning. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's pretty dry. Just do all the assignments and jump through the hoops and you'll end up with a good grade/some new content knowledge. Justin's a great guy but he's just not cut out for lecturing. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's really interesting. Lecture is quite dry - Justin seems like a super cool guy, and he puts a ton of effort into the class, but 1.5 hours is just a long time to be sitting there. Lecture got better as the quarter went off with more demonstrations, engangement, etc. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
it's super interesting 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Its decent but can be a lot of work 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Justin really wants everyone to do well and there are tons of resources available. Some of the examples are pretty technical, but they scale up to explain larger concepts explained by neuroscientific research. If you're interested in psychology or the brain, this class is a great start. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Keep up with the readings and go to class. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
kind of boring 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Lectures and sections are somewhat all over the place, but provides a broad exposure to several topics. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Lectures are kinda boring and long. Thought questions and quizzes were really helpful for making me stay on top of the material. So even when I was behind on lectures and readings, I was forced to engage with stuff each week and wasn't hopelessly behind when I went to study for the midterm and the final 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Lectures were incredibly dull, and felt I didn't learn anything there. Gardner should really work on making his lectures more engaging and organized. I went to two lectures all quarter, did maybe 5 readings. Used the study guides to learn the material (study guides were AMAZINGLY useful, please keep using them.) Did really well in the class just from keeping up with thought questions and quizzes, going to section, and cramming before the tests. Few textbook readings or lectures actually necessary to succeed in the class 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Loved this class. Lectures were sometimes a bit long but all the info is necessary, skipping lecture and looking at the ppt just wont work 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Loved this course. It was very accessible, and was taught to a level that was very comprehensive and engaging. Very interesting topics and Justin Gardner is a great lecturer. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Make sure to look over study guides, very helpful 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Material can be really interesting, but lectures can be kind of long and dry. Some of the questions on problem sets or midterms can be written poorly. However, the teaching staff is doing its best to integrate sections, lectures, and readings, and it shows. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Prof. Gardner is a very good lecturer. At first he seems quiet and not that excited about teaching but that not the case at all. The lectures continue to get better throughout the course. He's really interesting so ask lots of of questions. Really interesting material. Put effort into the thought questions as they will help you do well on the exams. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Really neat class, especially if you have never taken anything like it before! The lectures can be a little dry, but the content is very interesting. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Really really interesting stuff to learn - definitely take it if you have any interest in psych. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Review everything you learned in a given week because there's a lot of material. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Solid intro, covers a lot of material quickly without significant depth in any topic 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Take it - but find ways to keep up with the material 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Take it if you want to know about the brain 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Take it its interesting and well done! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Take it! Even if you don't think you like brains or that brains aren't interesting, I promise you will learn to appreciate some little-known but amazing things humans can do without even thinking about it. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
take it! Great class workload manageable, you'll learn a lot and it's important to know about how your brain works. Don't be intimidated by the title 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Take it! You'll learn so much, and the quality of instruction is really high. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Take it- the material is very interesting! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The class definitely is very interesting and there will be a large volume of information that needs to be processed. It is very methodically organized, so much so I wished there was more spontaneity. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The course could be interestingly but the lectures are poorly designed - the PowerPoint slides are terrible, which can make it tough to follow the main point of that which is being discussed 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The course material is really interesting, and the teaching staff are really supportive. Lectures are useful, although a bit hard to stay awake in. Always do your thought questions since they help you learn the week's topic and prepare you for the midterm. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The lectures can become quite boring but make sure you are always present in the sections because they are a great way to grasp the concepts from the class. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The material in this class is very engaging, but the instruction is fair at best. I think the root of the problem is that Justin doesn't respect the intellect of the students enough. Lecture after lecture, he only asks the simplest or even stupidest questions to the audience, and even though everyone knows the answer, no one answers because the question is so simple. Instead, he needs to ask questions that require students to synthesize or analyze, rather than just regurgitate what he's been talking about for 10 minutes. Then, it appears, he assumes that no one actually knows the answer, and he proceeds to re-explain like we're in middle school, which often just confuses people. But, because of the incredibly interesting material, I'd still recommend taking this class to a friend. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The material is interesting, though sometimes presented dryly. Take it if you'd like a survey of directions in neuroscience and the current knowledge of neurobiology. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The material is super interesting and really the only reason to take the course. Gardner is obviously a very bright man but a terrible lecturer. Often difficult to hear, difficult to follow what he is saying, and uses the slides in a generally confusing manner. You learn everything from the readings and section (if your TA is good) 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The material is super interesting but the lectures drag on a bit--I wish they were a bit more engaging. Justin Gardner seems very knowledgeable and if you find neuroscience interesting you'll like the course overall. Sections are fun and really help with understanding of the material. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
The more engaged you are with the readings and thought questions, the more easily you can retain material presented in section. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
They really put a lot of work into making the sections really engaging and helpful for getting an intuition about the processes that were examined by studies mentioned in lecture. The lecture is not the most engaging, but Justin makes really good slides and weekly study guides that help you get a really good sense of the major concepts. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
This class offers a broad overview of different cognitive processes and how changes in the brain impact external actions. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
This class was super interesting and had fantastic lectures and section activities. Definitely doable without previous experience in psychology! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
This is a pretty cool course! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
This is a very great course. Put in a lot of effort and you will learn a lot. It is extremely well taught. One of the best introductory courses here at Stanny. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Use the study guides 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
very interesting material, just need to be willing to take the time to go through a lot of the material on your own. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
Weekly thought questions are a colossal pain and often are only tangentially related to lectures or readings. These extra hoops to jump through, along with quizzes, made the class feel like death by 1000 cuts. Terrible and inconsistent grading on the midterm as well (I say this despite having gotten ~95-96%). The material is interesting, and Justin tries to share why he is excited about it, but the teaching and grading process needs serious work overall. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
would highly recommend! extremely well taught and super organized!! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
You will learn a lot! Even if you have no previous knowledge of cognitive neuro, Justin Gardner is a great lecturer who makes the information accessible and interesting. Tests and assignments are very reasonable, and I feel like it's very fascinating material in general. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
You'll get more out if it if you invest more into it. Lectures are the most useful so pay attention (: 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2016/2017, Winter)
A fantastic course! Stick with it, it's a lot of work but you learn a lot and it's worth it. The midterms and final are very fair as well. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
A lot of busy work but quite easy. but teaching staff is really sincere so maybe they'll revamp the course 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Be careful to make sure that you are picking out important topics and focusing energy on those. It's easy to not learn anything with all of the information thrown at you, so make sure you're able to identify what is important. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Be careful. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Cognitive Neuroscience is an interesting field. Through a combination of readings, videos, etc.you should be able to teach yourself most of the material. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Consider finding other resources that more clearly define the concepts introduced in lecture and in the readings. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Cover a lot of interesting material. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do as much of the reading as possible 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do it 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do the readings for the quizzes and ask questions in section . 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't take it. It's more work than it should be, and there isn't really any support for folks who are new to the sciences. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't try to memorize all of the information. Focus on the thought questions and lecture/section information. Use textbook as background 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Go to lectures and sections! Book readings are only relevant for the quizzes. Test material heavily based on lectures and sections. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Go to office hours because it is not clear what you're actually supposed to know or be studying for the exams, and the TAs might help better 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
good 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Good course; pretty helpful teaching staff; lots of biology. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the course you'll most likely find some parts interesting and some parts quite boring (I for one found memorizing biological details about synapses quite tangential to my purpose for taking the course). Overall would recommend though. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
good intro to cognitive neuroscience. teaching team is clearly working hard to dynamically improve the class structure. textbook is dense but a good resource. this class made me consider a neuroscience concentration in symsys. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I am not sure I would recommend it. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I hope they make some changes. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I think the teaching staff made amazing improvements over the course of the quarter, and I bet it will be an even better experience next quarter. Hopefully they'll revise the readings, but if they don't, stay patient with the textbook! You'll learn a lot 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I think there are better psych classes to take. This is really biology heavy 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would encourage them to try to focus both on the broad picture as well as specific examples that support each main idea. It is extremely important to understand each brain region and how they are functionally localized to perform certain tasks and behaviors. Thought questions and quizzes are both helpful in reinforcing your learning. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would recommend against it. It does not provide a good introduction to brain structure or function. Most information provided is either extremely specific or so broad and vague that it has no meaning at all. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would recommend it, but I would let them know that it requires a certain amount of investment and time commitment to get as much as possible out of it. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would say that the material is very interesting, and that I would hope that it would be slightly more organized/focused after the experience this quarter. I would still recommend taking it, because I learned a lot. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would suggest that they skim the readings before class, but not much more. That way they'll keep up to date and be able to do the quizzes and they won't get too bogged down. I would suggest to pay close attention to the thought questions, too. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would wait to take it after it has been offered a few more times because the course and lectures especially need a lot more improvement 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
I wouldn't lectures are pretty boring and the material is really dense. The material is interesting it's just that it's slightly too dense for me. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
If you have the slightest interest in psychology/neuroscience then take this class! It will expand your interests in the field. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Informative, interesting course. Stay on top of the homework. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
interesting if haven't taken similar courses before 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is a good course in which you learn a lot, but sometimes lectures can be a little bit dry as well as textbook readings. I thought that it was good that tests were more of an application of the knowledge of the things that you learn instead of simple memorization, which it could certainly be. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is challenging but evolving to try and refine the process for students and it is a crazy interesting class 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is interesting material but taught in a very disjointed manner 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
It was a lot of content - some content unnecessary (from the book) but you still have to rifle through the book to sift out the unimportant material... so it's still a lot of reading and work. Blegh. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
It was with a new instructor when I took it, so it wasn't very organized, but it should get better with time! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's a good course 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Its a lot a lot of reading, can be interesting once you get passed the very dense material. section and thought questions were good 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Its a well constructed class. The classes are essential for doing well on the midterm and final. The chapter reading are bit much. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure to provide feedback- the professor and TAs were very receptive to student feedback my quarter! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure to stay on top of readings 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure you take it with an experienced professor. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Only take if you have to. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Please don't take it with Justin Gardner until he knows what he is doing in lecture. He even took the time to have a department of education person come in to ask us how the class could be improved mid-quarter, and Justin took none of the advice that we gave. He claimed to be really excited to teach this class, but actions speak louder than words; he hardly seemed invested, and refused to connect anything together. His lecture slides, while filled with pictures, really added nothing to our knowledge, and everything he talked about was at a very in depth level; we simply did not have the level of knowledge that he has, nor did he realize that. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Please go to section and pay attention in them - that's where a lot of the digestible material appears. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Pretty Interesting, but DO THE TEXTBOOK READINGS!! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Pretty interesting. A lot of opportunity to do well in it 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Provides a good introduction to cognitive neuroscience but not the best organized course; perhaps not the best way to receive an introduction to the brain. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Read the book and don't get behind 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Really use the lectures and sections (especially in concurrence with thought questions) to focus your learning. This really helped me to get the sweeping overview of concepts, and then I went back to focus on more of the nitty gritty details. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
sections are useful, lectures are boring and not very well taught. Lecturer assumes you know much more than you are supposed to know for an introductory class. Lectures are not engaging. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it if you're interested or if you need it for a major requirement. As a heads up, the class is mostly biology, the psych doesn't come into play until later in the quarter. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
take it it is sickkkk 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it it's necessary for psych majors 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
TAKE IT IT'S WORTH IT 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take notes while you read and do the study guide very thoroughly! It's a ton of information but it's super interesting if you take the time 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take notes while you read!! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
textbook is dense and not the most well-written 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
The material is very interesting and though the class was undergoing some structural changes, the work is worth it for coming out of the class having learned really important basic skills for understanding and engaging in brain research. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
The reading quizzes are a pain. The sections are the most relevant parts for tests. You don't really need to go to lecture, and the slides aren't super helpful either. Use the book and section notes to study. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
The textbook is very helpful, and study guides are EXTREMELY effective for learning. I would say quizzes are important to take (some) notes on, definitely take some time to learn the material on your own or else you might not be sure what you've learned in the end. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
The topics presented in this course are very interesting. If anything, take the course because the information is important for current understanding of neuroscience in society. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
there is a lot of reading and work but if you are interested in how the brain works this will be an interesting course for you 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
This class was a good introduction to the basic ideas and experiments underlying cognitive neuroscience. To me, the course seemed more heavy on the psychological aspects of the field than on the neurobiological aspects, so I would recommend it only if that is the kind of introduction to neuroscience you are looking for. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course has a lot of interesting material. There is a bit of a disconnect between the different components of the course and you might feel lost at times, but I am hopeful that the course will get better. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course has potential. This quarter was the first quarter taught by this instructor, and as such, material was still being developed. I feel that after this trial period, the next time this is taught it will be excellent 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course is definitely dense, and covers a wide variety of topics. Do not expect to have a complete understanding of all concepts, but if you put in a lot of individual effort it is definitely possible to wet your feet. I do not recommend taking this course as your first psychology course as it is very dense, and some background would probably assist in this course. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course provides a good introduction to cognitive neuroscience, and I recommend it to any student with an interest in the topic. Engaging demonstrations helped introduce and clarify important conceptual elements from the course. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course seemed all over the place, and it was hard to tell what was actually relevant information. The material is interesting, but it can get confusing. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is a challenging course but super fun and useful! 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
try to just gain the important points of the course, don't focus on specifics, you'll get bogged down 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
Very interesting content, especially if you are interested in neuroscience and cognitive function 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
You don't realize how much you've learned until you go to study for the midterm/final. It's pretty engaging, cool material though once you've studied. 
(with Gardner, Justin, 2015/2016, Winter)
