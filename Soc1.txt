-TAs take FOREVER to grade things for literally such a small class. It's ridiculous and makes it hard to track your grade in the class -grading isn’t standardized (between the TAs). One of them grades alot harder than the other, which isn't fair

Come prepared to engage and speak up in class. The course is very interactive and the instructor is very engaging. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely recommend!! Tomas is a great instructor who is passionate about what he is teaching about. You learn about the basics of sociology as an academic subject and are able to have a lot of interesting discussions about the issues in the world around you. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely take it! Professor Jimenez is AMAZING (and really funny!!). His lectures are super interesting because he engages a lot with the students and makes it more of a discussion-based lecture. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Do the readings to reference for the essays. Appreciate Jimenez's passion and personability. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Go to class, attendance is held to a high standard 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Great way to get 5 credits for less than an hour of out-of-class work per week. Not very much actual material, so it's not particulary interesting, but the second half of the class is less bland 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Hardest introductory class I've taken. Pointlessly hard, yet the professor wants you to declare soc after grilling you all quarter 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I definitely recommend taking Intro to Sociology, especially with Professor Tomas Jimenez. He is wonderful with the material and makes it engaging and fun! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I think every single Stanford undergraduate should take this class! Not only is the content important because it discusses so many important topics, but it is also taught in a great way. Professor Jimenez is truly remarkable! He is such a phenomenal professor who cares about his students, but he is also very energetic and extremely funny. I recommend taking this class your freshman year because you'll be exposed to really cool ideas and to a great professor! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I think that every student should take this introductory course. It is meaningful in many different aspects that pertain to everyones lives. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I was always excited to go to this class because Prof. Jimenez makes the classes so fun and interesting! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I would highly recommend this class. Breaking down the elements of our society was extremely interesting and allowed me to look at topics from many different perspectives. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I would say if they think they are interested in the social sciences they should look into it. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I would say take a lot of notes from the lecture. Also, do some outside readings based on the course material to fully take advantage of the course. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
it was very interesting and well taught 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a great class. Prof Jimenez does an awesome job making it interesting, and it's a valuable subject to take at least once in college. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a very fun class. The instructor is funny. A lot of reading though so make sure you keep up with them as they are important for understanding concepts in the class. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's the easiest 5 units ever, but you don't learn a lot. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Its a good introductory course for learning the basics. It covers a lot of cool topics like race, gender, class, and nationhood. The first half of the class is fairly abstract, but it gets more interesting and practical. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Mr. Jimenez did a very good job teaching the material and a lot was covered. Do the readings and the class will be a lot easier. You have to be comfortable writing because there are a lot of essays. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Pretty straightforward course; good background to figure out if you're interested in sociology but not super in-depth if you already know a specific subject you'd like to dive deep in. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Professor Jiménez is a very fun professor who taught a great class. I feel like I have a good base of knowledge about sociology now. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Professor Jimenez is a FANTASTIC teacher! He makes lectures so fun and engaging, telling great jokes and using anecdotes and current events to keep everything relevant. I learned so much from him and enjoyed myself too! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Professor Jimenez is awesome. Take this course and it is easy A if you do the work. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Soc. 1 is awesome, but the professor is AWESOME!!!! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it! Gives you a great background in sociology and Tomás is a terrific lecturer! he's funny and engaging and loves to interrupt himself to talk about random stories that have pretty much nothing to do with what the lecture is on. the essay questions are challenging but you learn all the tools you need to answer them 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it! Jimenez is a wonderful instructor. Compared to psych 1, it may not feel as though you're "learning as much", but I believe that's due to the nature of of the different fields, not a reflection of the class itself. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take this class! Prof. Jiménez is a great lecturer and the class really gets you think about your personal narrative and how that narrative has been and is continuously shaped by and shaping society. Truly a great class with intriguing conversations and active participation with students. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The professor is very knowledgeable and also engages students very well
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This course can sneakily be a lot of work. Some of the prompts for papers, midterms, and the final were very vague which made the papers more difficult than they should have been. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This course is great for students who wish to gain a new perspective on aspects we overlook in our society, including race, class, gender, stratification, immigration, nationality, etc. I enjoyed pushing my comfort zone by 'making things strange' and questioning every day encounters. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This course is very interesting and Professor Jimenez makes it very fun. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
very interesting class with a lot of cool readings! jiménez keeps things interesting 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
you will learn very broadly about super important topics like race, class, gender, etc. not not too in depth in each 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Do the readings and go to class. It's a very enjoyable and entertaining class! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Go to class, the professor is a great lecturer 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Great instructor, very interesting. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
I love this course and am so thankful that I decided to take it. Jimenez is an incredible professor who makes the lessons stick and you learn so much through his methods of making the familiar strange. The course is very eye-opening and gives you a taste of a broad range of social issues if you're interested in exploring a little of everything. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would recommend it 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would tell them to take it! This course has honestly been one of the best classes I have taken at Stanford. My favorite part are the assignments because they allow me to think outside the bubble. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
If you're interested in sociology but not too sure, try this course. It is a good class to get your foot in the water. Or if you're curious about sociology, try it. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
It doesn't go very far into depth in any one topic, but is a great introduction to sociological thinking 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is an awesome introduction class. I feel like I have a very good idea of what sociology includes and what it is about. The instructor is very passionate and very interactive. He clearly explains the topics and helps you to have a further understanding of the material. He is interesting and presents the ideas in ways that keep you intrigued. The TA's are very available and they all want you to do well in the class. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
it's a super interesting course and doing all the work is worth your time! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
its a great course and Professor Jimenez is excellent 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Jimenez is a great professor, the material he lectures is interesting and he really tries to make it easy to understand. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
make sure to do the readings 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure you do the readings and take notes so that you can reference both when doing the assignments. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Professor Jimenez is a wonderful lecturer, and very approachable. I learned a lot about the many scopes of sociology and its relation to the world around us. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Readings are very different from lectures. You'll get exposed to a lot of topics but won't really get into detail on any of them. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it! I think it was great and it definitely makes me consider majoring in soc 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
take it! super cool professor and not a huge workload 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it, it's interesting and very relevant for pre-medical students as well 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take the class. Interesting material and great lectures from Tomás 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
This class helps you better understand how and why social institutions and constructions are they way they are today and how they have evolved over time and space. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
This class is very fun and interesting. You can apply a lot of the information to the real world, plus the instructer is great and keeps the class entertaining! 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is a class I would probably recommend that everyone take. It really got me to think about our society in a more curious and critical way, and it was just so incredibly interesting to examine all of the parts of daily life that typically go unexamined. I also think that learning about issues such as mass incarceration in America has made me more attuned to the ways in which our current social structures fail us. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is a great intro class that offers a broad, yet not necessarily in depth discussion of sociological phenomena. 
(with Jimenez, Tomas, 2015/2016, Winter)
