Carefully read all the readings and critically engage with what is said before coming to class or sections. it will provide a better understanding for the content in the lectures.

Definitely do. Bratman is in the top three teachers I've had at Stanford.

Definitely take it. One of the best philosophy courses I've taken at Stanford. The material relates to so many issues in contemporary analytical philosophy and quality instruction from Bratman helps one develop crucial tools along the way.

Michael Bratman is the rare combination of brilliant scholar and excellent teacher. He makes a highly technical field feel intuitive and inviting, and never overplays the fact that it is a field which he largely revolutionized.

one of the best courses at Stanford!

Take it if you're ready to commit a fair amount of time to tackling some difficult material! Bratman is a great lecturer but at times it can get a little bit boring or over one's head.... BUT some of the stuff that comes up is very very interesting. I recommend connecting it to other dimensions of philosophy you find interesting (law, morality, etc.) if you ever feel like the material is too abstract- which you will probably feel.

The course requires prior background in philosophy. Almost all of the readings are primary texts, which may be challenging reads to those who have limited experience reading philosophy. The course also covers a great deal of material.

This class is a lot of work but is extremely rewarding. I learned more in it than I have in any other philosophy class, because Professor Bratman is a stellar lecturer and interlocutor and because Jared and JJ are excellent teaching assistants.

This is a very interesting class with engaging lectures if you pay close enough attention. I would highly recommend taking notes on all the readings and lectures and make sure you really understand all of the arguments from the very beginning. I only started taking motes on the readings about half way through and it was incredibly helpful. It will take a lot longer to do the readings when you are pausing to write, but it will really make a difference! I found the class very satisfying even though I will probably never think about the philosophy of action again.

VERY hard material, but very worthwhile. Some of the best food for thought; this class was a meal for the mind in terms of offering lots to think about that was thoroughly interesting. Each week we delved into an element of action, intention, and agency that was fascinating. But very abstract and hard to understand at times. 
(with Bratman, Michael E, 2017/2018, Winter)
At the end of each reading, write a couple sentences on the position of the author and how it relates to the previous readings. Its so easy to get bogged down by the many different viewpoints! Also, there is a lot of reading and not much of it is normative philosophy. If you are primarily interested in responsibility for actions, do not take this class because you will not discuss it. 
(with Bratman, Michael E, 2016/2017, Winter)
It is incredibly dense material, but the grade structure is lenient. 
(with Bratman, Michael E, 2016/2017, Winter)
It's a good class, but you don't talk much about free will or morality, so don't take it if that's primarily what you're interested in. 
(with Bratman, Michael E, 2016/2017, Winter)
Make sure to pay attention from the start to understand the lay of the land -- otherwise the rest of the class will go over your head. Lectures weren't very engaging -- Bratman usually just spoke at the class, without any use of the whiteboard or another visual aid to follow along with (he had paper notes, but it wasn't clear where he was in the notes). 
(with Bratman, Michael E, 2016/2017, Winter)
make sure you are firm about putting things in writings so that things are concrete and if the ta doesn't give good comments back make appointments with hume and/or talk to the prof

Michael Bratman is an excellent lecturer and great at discussing his field of expertise. Highly recommend for his engaging lectures. 
(with Bratman, Michael E, 2016/2017, Winter)
Professor Bratman is incredible and a leader in this field. It's truly an honor to get to learn Phil of Action from him. If you like thinking deeply about small things and like philosophy then definitely take this course 
(with Bratman, Michael E, 2016/2017, Winter)
The material is incredibly difficult, but thought provoking and worthy of your attention!
