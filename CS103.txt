 If you plan on taking the class, take it soon. The problem sets are getting longer every quarter, and with the addition of programming assignments, you'll find yourself struggling to keep up. - Do not take this class with 103, or literally any other class that has work. The problem sets are most painful from Week 4 to 6, right around midterms. - If you have not done proofs, you will be at a severe disadvantage in this class, especially for the first half of the class. - The slides are very helpful, way more helpful than the lectures. The in class PollEv system kinda slow lectures down a bit. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
A beautiful subject, that is overshadowed by what seems like pedantry. If you enjoy a debate over, "if A=B, then does B=A?", or a consideration of "does 1 1 actually equal 2?", then this class is for you. Good luck. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
An interesting but challenging course that will push you to think in new ways. Very little math background is required. Don't be discouraged by harsh grading since it pushes you to work harder. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Apparently I have the top grade in this class so far; I also strongly dislike this class, and think you should avoid it if at all possible. Try to skip it, and take CS 154 instead. If you want to learn proof-writing, take an actual Math class that teaches proof-writing. They'll do a better job, and won't leave you with the false impression that math is all about writing everything according to some rubric. If you do want to get marks on the PSets, expect to spend far too many hours per week combing over every line of every proof to check that it's all "load-bearing". Expect to grasp the concepts immediately, but then to debate your partner for 30 minutes about how best to write it down. Expect to spend far too long considering every single edge-case in proofs. Expect to submit regrade requests most weeks, because it seems like some TAs are far harsher than others - I got 15% back one week. Expect very little help from the TAs, because they are allowed to tell you pretty much nothing. And expect to rewrite pretty much the same proofs 4-5 times each, because the PSets are long and repetitive. In my opinion (and I'm certainly a minority) this class takes an accessible and cool topic - theoretical computer science - and turns it into an incredibly boring and difficult grind by making it about dull, repeated, nitpick-y proofs. This class could be so much more, and I'm disappointed really. Lastly, I'm not sure 103 is as well-taught as people say it is. The teaching of self-referential programs was really unclear, and left the whole class confused. Then my friend explained it to me in like 4 minutes after lecture, much better than Keith/Cynthia did. That just shouldn't be happening given that Stanford CS has paid lecturers working full-time on this stuff... Do better, 103.

Be ready for a lot of work. It's very doable if you stay ahead of the game, and definitely make use of office hours. Also be very detailed about how you write your proofs - they nit pick quite a lot!

(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Buckle up. It's a long and turbulent ride. The material really is interesting, but this class takes a lot of time and if you don't stay on top of it you will get lost.

Cool stuff, good amount of work, frustrating grading 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
CS103 is one of the most well-organized and well thought out courses at Stanford! Definitely take it even if its not part of your major. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
CS103 literally has no chill. It is 10 weeks of INTENSE PAIN. Be prepared for completely new and abstract concepts that you've never heard of before, for exhausting psets that you can't understand without going to office hours, and for inconsistent grading that leaves you frustrated and confused. The lines in office hours are crazy long - you'll arrive five minutes early, be 5th in line, and a TA won't get to you until an hour later. (and office hours only last two hours at a time, so imagine what the people who are 11th or 12th in line are feeling). Keith and Cynthia always tell you to "go to office hours if you're still confused!" but that's useless advice when you can't even get your questions answered in office hours because the TAs move at the speed of a snail and there are thousands of other desperate kids in need of help too. In addition, the grading in this course is harsh and inconsistent. If you make one little mistake in your proof, they'll give you zero points for execution, even if the rest of your answer matches the solutions perfectly. There is literally no partial credit in this course whatsoever. You either ace the pset, or you completely bomb it. No in-betweens. Finally, one of the reasons why this class is so grueling is just how much information they try to pack into your brain in 10 weeks. Literally, every lecture introduces 3-4 new concepts, and there are 3 lectures a week! There is never any time to sit down and digest all of the information you're learning, because in the blink of an eye, a new pset is out, the midterm is approaching, and you're behind because you took a late day. The psets are LONG and HARD. It's also mentally draining that this class has 2 midterms AND that you still have equally long and hard psets due the same week as the midterms. If you take time to study for the first midterm, you'll fall behind on the current pset, and it's just a snowball effect from there - you'll try to catch up so that you can study for the second midterm, but this class JUST NEVER STOPS. By the time the second midterm rolls around, you have no idea what's happening in lecture and you've almost used up all your late days. And you STILL don't have time to study for the midterm. In the course of 10 weeks, you learn the same amount of information as other students taking a similar course in other universities do in one semester, or even a year. This class is a nightmare, so be prepared to be dragged along for the ride. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Definitely a must-take course, but be ready for a lot of work if you have no experience proof-writing. PSets for this class took me longer than for any other class. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Definitely take this class. It gives you a toolset that will be invaluable no matter what you end up doing later on. It's one of those courses where you really feel like you're using a totally new part of your brain and now I'm excited to let it out! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Definitely take this course! It’s a really interesting experience and you’ll learn about stuff you never knew before. You’ll definitely be a better problem solver by the end! Just make sure to keep up with lecture content and ask questions if you have them to get misunderstandings cleared up early! If you work hard and stay focused you’ll have a great time! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
DO ALL PSETS QUESTIONS. DO ALL PRACTICE QUESTIONS. DO ALL PRACTICE MIDTERMS AND FINALS.

(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Don't 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Don't be deceived. Keith charms you into believing you can succeed in this course as long as you work your butt off but this is simply not the case. The truth is that half the class are either geniuses or have already taken the class so you will be struggling to keep up. Not to mention that the curve is practically nonexistent and the grading for the psets is so subjective. Overall I learned a lot of new material in this course but my mental and physical health suffered as a result :( 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Don't fall behind

Don't fall behind, make sure you always understand everything. Do a lot of practice. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Don't join late. Do the psets and ask for help if you need it. The class is really interesting, but you really can't fall behind without being extremely stressed. Keith is amazing.

dont take this class. just dont. not rewarding at all. this class wrecked me no matter how i tried to improve. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Focus on your improvement. This class is difficult and is meant to challenge you. Don't become discouraged when you are faced with a problem you can't immediately solve. The instructors provide you with the proper tools to figure out the problems, so always start with what you know because it can get you pretty far. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Go through problem sets thoroughly. Grading rubrics are fairly strict and can sometimes be arbitrary. Take good notes or have friends that are comfortable with the concepts since the lectures move quickly, and the lecture slides can be difficult to understand if it's your first time dealing with this sort of thing. Office hours have unbearably long wait times later in the week, so try to finish problem sets early. Lots of practice problems are provided - take advantage of them to get a solid grasp of the material. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Go to lectures and office hours! Get a partner ASAP! Don't be afraid to ask questions on piazza. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Go to office hours! While you may have intuition to a problem, it's helpful to run your solution with the TAs to make sure that you understand the execution. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Go to office hours, they are your savior!!! Just do the psets in office hours and you'll do them much quicker than you would at home. Other than that, don't skip lectures or material if possible because the class goes very fast and it's hard to catch back up. Also would recommend taking the class with Keith rather than Cynthia because he knows a little more about the class.

I came into this class exhausted by school and burnt out after CS107, and comforted myself through the first week of this quarter by fantasizing taking a leave of absence. But as crazy as it might sound, this class revitalized my excitement for CS and made me fall in love with theory. Before, I always thought that I wanted to pursue CS more because I believed in its potential to make positive change in the world rather than because I was intellectually/academically interested in the field. Well, this class has officially turned me into a CS nerd. Catch me in 5 years starting my PhD in CS theory (jk...mostly). Keith is an incredible teacher and a wonderful person. This class wasn't easy for me by any measure, but at the end you will have learned so much. I believe in you!! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
I hope you're better at this stuff than I was 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
I struggled with this course. It was a bit discouraging to go to office hours for a long time and working really hard for the first few weeks and then not seeing the return on problem sets. I guess something just didn't click for me. Hopefully you have a better time. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
If you can, take a discrete mathematics class before this class. The learning curb for discrete math is high if you're not the best writer. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
If you don't have previous math/proof-writing experience, this is a good introduction. If you have adequate previous math/proof-writing experience, take a harder class like CS154. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
If you have a background in proof-based mathematics, it's probably not worth taking. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
If you’re a math person, take CS154. The grading in this class is unnecessarily harsh and will hurt you a lot if you already know how to write proofs. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
In classic Keith fashion, he claims to help underrepresented students get traction in CS but he’s a straight white dude that does literally nothing to help people that are struggling besides saying “go to OH!!” where his condescending and overworked TAs literally tell you the wrong answers. In addition to psets every single week (even midterm weeks), you have to spend an additional 5-10 hours every week reviewing lecture material and we had the additional fun challenge of reteaching ourselves every single topic that Cynthia attempted to lecture on. Get ready for a miserable quarter. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Incredibly interesting class and you will learn a ton. However, note that the grading often feels very arbitrary and that can be really frustrating. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It is an interesting class though the lectures are not always useful though they require attendance. The grading is unreasonably harsh, so be prepared to get a low grade unless you get everything perfectly correct. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It may seem hard at first because you're completely changing your way of thinking. Enjoy the struggle. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It will be a rough course. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a good class but you have to put in the work. Start the problem sets early. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a grind! A big step-up from most other CS or math classes. Compared to all the math 50 series and the 106 series, 103 is definitely harder. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a hard class so be aware of how much time you may have to put in.

(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a super awesome and useful class, but don't get behind on course material. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a tough course, make no mistakes about it. It requires a commitment to working on the material and structuring your thoughts to navigate the problems. I think it became highly rewarding for me, as the end of the course approaches huge questions that nobody yet knows the answer to. If this sounds like your thing, definitely take it. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's a tough course, no doubt about it! I will admit, I did not pass this class with flying colors. I will say, though, that I learned a heck of a lot! The material that is covered is phenomenal. You'll undoubtedly leave the course with loads and loads of new knowledge. You'll learn about things you never previously knew existed!! This class is 100% worth taking, even if it is quite challenging. I don't think a bad grade ever killed anybody. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's definitely one of the harder CS intro classes. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
It's sad that this class is a requirement for CS majors and minors. I don't think anyone should need to take this class. Whereas 107 was a difficult class with useful applications, 103 was a difficult class with no real point. Do I care if P=NP? (which keith pointed out to be the most important question in theoretical computer science) No. I have NEVER been so unmotivated to do the assignments for a class, and as someone who has been put through PWR 1 and PWR 2 I think that says a lot. Keith and Cynthia, while extremely intelligent, seem to lack a general understanding of humanity. They assigned long psets every week without fail. I clearly remember attending lecture on new material, the day of a 3 hour 103 midterm, and turning in an 11 problem pset the friday of that same week. Psets themselves are tedious and quite different from what we do in lecture, at least in my opinion. Speaking on lecture, Keith and Cynthia try to throw in jokes to make this content interesting, but it truly is a journey trying to pay attention to more than 3 seconds of lecture. At the beginning of the quarter, the professors would spend way too long talking about relatively unimportant information and then Keith would throw out the "now we have 20 minutes of material to cover in 15 minutes" and speed through the true meat of the presentation in 5 seconds. I feel like we can describe this class in a similar fashion "let me cover 1 year's material in 11 weeks!" I don't even know what to say, because you have to take this class. Hope you survive it with your sanity. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
its hard but u probably need it for your major. you'll learn a lot 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Just note that a lot of the grading is not really based on whether or not you understand the material, but whether or not every single detail of your response matches theirs 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Keith is a great lecturer and knows a lot about the class and how to teach it. Cynthia's lectures were very disorganized and spent way too much time on easy concepts, then not having any time for the difficult questions at the end. Also one time at her office hours I was too scared to ask her a question about the PSET because she was on the phone planning her family vacation to DC. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Keith is a very engaging teacher. The class content is easy. However, it is made hard by asking very creative hard questions in problem sets and exam. Don't underestimate it. The grading has a lot of randomness involved and depends a lot on the TA that graded your work. Some TA understand the material well enough to recognize a good solution. Others just look for a copy of the official solution. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Keith is amazing, and so is Cynthia! Also, the TAs are great - certain ones more than others, but the ones that are great are really great. The PSets I don't necessarily think are the best, but really I would just say learn the material - however you do it best, do it that way, and it'll turn out fine in the end. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Keith is an amazing lecturer. If you are taking with Cynthia, just look at the slides, because she doesn't do much other than read them - you would need to study on your own. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Keith is great - I'd avoid Cynthia if possible 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
keith is VERY good, but get ready to not get the grades you want 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Keith's teaching is phenomenal but the TAs' grading is frankly bordering on abhorrent. When you get points off for starting a proof "By contrapositive. --" instead of "By contrapositive; --" it's incredibly frustrating. When you spend a while figuring out a proof on your own instead of going to office hours and then you get the majority of the points for the question taken off for coming up with a valid but "overly complicated" answer it's also head-bashingly frusting and, even worse, incredibly demoralizing. You probably have to take this course, if you like logical thinking and math you're pretty much guaranteed to enjoy the material of this course, and you can do well in this course if you follow a couple rules: especially towards the beginning of the quarter, copy the format and style of example proofs religiously; read and abide by all style and syntax "guidelines" completely; read through pset answer keys and, ideally, the TAs' responses to your work if you can do so while maintaining your sanity. Good luck 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Learn a lot! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Look, this course is a serious commitment. It is a lot of work trying to cram this much theoretical math into 10 weeks. Work hard on the problem sets, study hard for the exams. Unless you like proofs and theoretical math, don't take the class unless you have to. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Lot of work on psets 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make sure that you stay on top of the material from the beginning of the quarter because things really build off of each other. Psets are long and hard. MAKE SURE TO WORK WITH A PARTNER. I don't know how people get through this class without a partner tbh. Try to do all of the pset by yourself before comparing answers with your partner. Some weeks that won't be possible (especially during midterm weeks when you still have equally long psets), but do your best. For midterms, do lots of practice midterms and try to go to the practice midterm if you can. Basically only take this class when you actually have the time to devote to it. Don't get discouraged if things are rough; lots of people struggle with this class. Good luck!! :) 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make sure to carve out a good deal of time for PSets 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make sure to find a partner for the problem sets. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make sure to prepare for the exams and try to understand the underlying concepts instead of just working week by week and slogging through the psets. The course moves extremely quickly but by the time you finish you will have learned a lot and feel very accomplished. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make sure you both intuitively understand the concepts and also have absurd attention to detail in proofs. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make sure you get a good instructor. Keith is wonderful... Cynthia, she needs work 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make sure you solidify your proof writing skills early so you don't get wrecked by the problem sets. Do lots of practice problems before the tests.
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Make time for problem sets!! And make good use of office hours. The grading is tough and nitpicky but it's like that for everyone so don't let that dishearten you.

Probably my favorite class I've taken at Stanford, possibly ever. This class I think is the one that has singularly expanded my brain the most, and I have gotten the most out of. Keith is a legend, and if he is teaching, I would say you should certainly take this class. But even if he is not, Cynthia is a great teacher too. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)

so fun, especially if you're in between a techie and a fuzzy! but prepare for a challenge and be on top of things :) 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Sometimes you will try your best and it won't be enough. Be okay with that. I've considered dropping out of Stanford because this class is so conducive to impostor syndrome, but realize that you are not the only one who feels that way. This class covers enough content to fill two quarters but its crammed into as little time as possible so be prepared to dedicate a lot of time and energy. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
start on psets early, have a good partner, do psets separately before doing them with a partner 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Start P-Sets early so you can go to TAs with specific questions. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Start the psets early. Go to OH when you get stuck. If you go to OH early, the queues won't be too bad. Get to know the TAs; they're the best TAs I've seen at Stanford. Review the (not-condensed) slides after every lecture. Ideally, find slides from previous quarters and review them before lecture, since the lectures cover a lot of material quickly. This class is time-consuming, but you'll learn so much, and the course staff is (actually) on your side. But you really should the class with Keith. The material can be incredibly dry and boring, but he presents it well. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Start the psets the day they come out. This class is a constant and brutal struggle for time. It takes about as much time as 107, but unfortunately is mind numbing after so many hours and you will reach a point where you just can't write any more proofs. This class is really hard and I'll leave it at that- take a light quarter because they ask a lot of you. I didn't think writing could be so hard! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Start those problem sets early. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Start your HW early!!!!!! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Super interesting topics, start the psets the weekend they come out, get a partner. Great class, big time commitment, worth it. Keith is iconic. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take a light quarter with it, and be prepared to learn a ton and work hard! Going in with zero experience with proof-writing, I now feel so much more confident and capable. Also, Keith is an amazing lecturer and talks very fast, so pay attention! I think Cynthia just needs some more practice teaching this course material because her lectures weren't as easy to follow 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it with a light load. The psets are so tedious and the grading of this class is extremely harsh, and the tiniest mistakes could be detrimental to your pset or exam grades. Harder than 107 and is definitely a weeder class for CS majors. I'm saying this because I wasn't adequately warned before I took it, and so I'm trying to warn you now. Good luck! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it with Keith if you can. Don't take it with Cynthia. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it with Keith!! His lectures are captivating. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
take it! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it! Keith is an absolutely amazing instructor and his energy is infectious. You may hear a lot of negative things about this course, but as someone with not much coding background who feels much more comfortable expressing my ideas/thought processes in actual words, I found this class incredibly refreshing and it provided me an entirely new way of looking at the world. If you go to lecture, ask for help at office hours, and devote your time to the problem sets, you will do well 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it! Might be a good move to take easier classes with CS 103, since it really is a lot of work, but you will feel that the time you put into this class is entirely worth it 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it! Work to improve based on the feedback you get and use the resources! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it. It's a challenge but it is rewarding and the problems are interesting and fun. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it. Learn lots of stuff. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it. You will learn a lot 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take the course! It's beautiful. If you are in any way a fundamentally curious person, it will leave you in awe. However, plan to budget 10-12 hours per week on the PSets (coming from someone who did well in the course). Plan to get started on Friday night, and be more than halfway done before Monday. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take this class! It's a lot of work, but you learn so, so much that you never knew about before! Be prepared for long hours on the PSets, and don't take it with 107. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take this course!! The instructors are simply amazing, and they really want you to do well in this course. They developed tons of online tools, tutorials and peripherals to make sure that you learn the materials as smoothly as possible. Mathematical proofs do sound daunting, but you'll eventually get the hang of it and begin to appreciate their beauty!! 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
taking it you know you can dedicate time to it. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Taking this class might feel like you have a dementor following you around slowly sucking your soul out. This class is not worth your mental health. If this class is hard for you it doesn't mean you're stupid. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Team up for the psets, it is so hard to them individually ! work on your proof writing skills! show up in the office hours, enjoy amazing Cynthia and Keith 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The content can be interesting at times. It's a cool look into the world of discrete math. Definitely find a partner for your psets!!!!!! and do as many practice problems as possible when studying 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The course is very theoretical and has a minimal amount of programming involved. Good course to take for people who really like math. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The focus of the class often gets shifted to the grading structure which can be fairly punitive/draconian. The content is interesting but you'll often spend more time focusing on details of wording proofs instead of on the content itself 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The handout titled "How to Improve" is generally very good advice, and should be heeded by all students (could this handout become available at the start of the course?) Practice your proofwriting skills, at first with easy problems; it will pay off handsomely. Observe the characteristics of "perfect" proofs given in the course reader, and try to emulate them in your own work. Learn from your mistakes on problem sets/midterms; this will also save a bunch of time and heartache. Always, always go back to the formal definitions; before you dive into any problem, you must have a decent understanding and ability to manipulate the formal definitions involved. Also—sketch out your proofs briefly before actually doing them. That way, you make sure it's a logical sequence of statements/conclusions, and you can easily restructure it if needed before doing the full write-up. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The problem sets are a ton of work, but the midterms aren't difficult. The material is challenging and, at times, weird, but it's an incredible mathematical journey. I learned a ton of new information, most of which I had no idea even existed. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The psets are really long and the grading is really picky. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The psets take a lot of time. Do not underestimate the difficulty of the course. Take it with Keith Schwarz 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The slides are all on the website and great resources to refer to 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
The things they take off points for will make you angry. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class has a lot of interesting material but it's way too much material packed into a 1 quarter class. As a result, you spend all your time cramming to finish the way too long psets rather than actually being able to understand and enjoy the material 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class improved my ability to think logically and systematically about new concepts. I find the material fascinating, the lectures were great, and the class is well organized. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is a lot of work (so much that it often feels impossible to feel like you understand the material). However, it is very well taught and will help organize your reasoning process. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is a lot of work but it is definitely rewarding. You will learn a lot about interesting topics from proof-writing to the complexity theory. Definitely take it but be prepared to get bad grades on problem sets. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is AMAZING!! It honestly has been the most enlightening class I have ever taken. It is also the most well taught class I have ever taken. The grading is nit-picky, but don't let that get to you. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is hard - probably harder than 107. There are so many concepts that you have to remember so don't get behind on lecture. OH lines are horrendous but still worth going. Did not enjoy this class too much personally. PSET grading is harsh initially but gets better the more you get used to it. Midterms and finals are tremendously important but difficult. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is incredibly well taught, and you will learn at ton about proofs and just gain a new way of thinking. However, this is a hard course; the first class at Stanford that I received a bad grade in, and I worked really hard. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is insanely hard. You will work for hours and hours. Have your psets checked at office hours only to still be deducted points for the smallest things. It is difficult to feel confident about how you are doing in the class because of how everything is graded 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is very fast paced; midterms might only cover topics taught up to 3 weeks prior to the exam. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class is, above all else, incredibly time-consuming. Especially in the first five/six weeks, expect to spend most of your time combing through proofs for trivial (and debatable) syntax errors. Although I did learn a great deal in this class, I also found there to be a noticeable divide in the material from the first six weeks and the material from the last four weeks. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
this class isn't a joke and definitely requires a lot of time and effort. the first and second half of the class don't have a lot in common, so it's likely you'll find one of them to be more/less challenging 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class really should be two separate courses. You should treat it as such, since it covers so much material that it takes a lot of time and energy to absorb all of it. Try to also take it during a quarter where the lectures are videotaped since you will want to re-watch them to try and understand some of the more complicated concepts. Go to office hours. Ask a lot of questions. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class takes a lot of time. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the psets! Get a pset group/buddy to read through your proofs to see if you have any logic holes. THE TAS ARE AMAZING- THEY WILL STAY UNTIL VERY LATE TO HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. BLESS THEM 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class was a trainwreck. I had Cynthia for 107 and I have to say I feel like at times she literally did not know what she was teaching. Both Cynthia and Keith would never finish content and consistently rush. The worst part about the class was how PSet's were graded. I would spend countless hours in office hours and get 70%'s yet get A's on the final. The PSet's do not remotely test your understanding of the course work and are absurd. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class will be a large time commitment, and I've heard from many it's worse than 107. With that being said you will learn a lot and it will make you a better mathematician, computer scientist and logician. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This class will take a lot of time but the only thing you have to focus on is writing proofs. They care more about the style and specific wording than about your learning the material and logic behind theories. Missing one word could cost you the entire problem. Go to office hours and just practice writing exactly what they tell you to do. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course does not provide a rigorous conceptual understanding of many of the topics they purport to teach, which frankly is just a fault of trying to cram too much into a quarter-long course. However, while it is not difficult to do well in the course without learning everything, I would recommend thoroughly learning the material because there actually is some interesting stuff going on. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course has been one of the most well taught STEM classes I've taken at Stanford. I felt like after every lecture my mind had been opened to a fascinating new concept that I haven't even thought of before. To truly understand and appreciate the knowledge and skills you learn in this course it takes a lot of time and commitment. Start the psets early and really actually pay attention in class - it's definitely worth it. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course is among my favorites. The level of organization is incredible, and the topics are very interesting as well, especially in the latter part of the quarter. It is obvious that a lot of work is put into making this course great, and I would recommend the course to anyone, regardless of their major. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course is really great! Try to take it with Keith if at all possible, because he knows what up for sure, but all around the problem sets feel like solving puzzles and can be really rewarding, though they take a long time. Grading can be a little harsh and annoying in that way, but if you stay on top of it with psets you'll be fine, and the exams aren't too difficult because they draw very directly from the material on problem sets 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course is really hard. It is like learning a new language and then learning new concepts in math and then learning how to solve those new concepts in that new language. The material is incredibly interesting but it's like drinking from a fire hose. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course requires a lot of work; If you can manage to stay on top of the coursework, then it can be an enjoyable experience with interesting content. Whenever I procrastinated, however, I found myself hating the class, but this can easily be avoided with a strong work ethic! Don't be discouraged by the difficulty--just work through it :) 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course will change how you think about a lot of things mathematically. You'll learn a lot from it, but it will be quite difficult. Take the time to do the psets and practice midterms, and try to find partner in the class to do them with. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This has been by far my favorite course at Stanford. Keith is an extremely enthusiastic educator who can get you excited about proofs. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This has been my favorite course at Stanford thus far. I would recommend it to any Stanford student, regardless of major. CS103 changed the way I approach problem solving and made me think in an entirely different way. Keith and Cynthia are great lecturers. Their passion for CS theory truly shines when they're teaching and they make class time fly by. Their presentation of material was very clear and easy to follow. The guides they provide as external resources are well organized and helpful. CS103 has one of the best TA teams I've ever interacted with as well. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is a class that you take and feel less confident coming out of. You will be graded not on your mathematical ability or your thoughtfulness on the topic content but how you write proofs and how to write them in ways only acceptable and applicable to this class. The content is only intersting at the end of the quarter and you spend way too much time covering basic things in too much detail (You spend like 5 lectures learning implications and then 1 on complexity theory it doesnt seem to line up very well). 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is a great course to take before you take proof based math courses to learn proof writing. Otherwise you will be annoyed and bored. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is an extremely demanding class, and grading is extremely unforgiving - very few partial credit points are given 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is an extremely interesting class, it was one of my favorites! It is also a challenging class because it makes you think about computer science and math in ways that you probably haven't thought about before 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is an intense class, but you learn a ton of interesting concepts. I'm glad I took it and I would recommend it for anyone who's interested in CS or math. Keith is a fantastic lecturer and made the concepts exciting. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is genuinely a tough and time-consuming class. Problem sets are EXTREMELY LONG, and the course is packed with information (a different topic every lecture, no breaks for the midterms---not even shorter problem sets!), all the way until the end of the course. Your mind will be slowly blown apart. I personally found it a challenging but rewarding course. My main personal complaint is that GRADING IS EXTREMELY INCONSISTENT. Some TA's would have vastly different expectations for proofs than others, and there is ALMOST NO PARTIAL CREDIT, meaning that if you miss part of the intuition, they don't even grade the rest of the proof and just give you 0 points. The system can be incredibly frustrating at times. Keith and Cynthia gave us a bunch of information and resources---but sometimes we're just swimming in handouts, and waiting in incredibly long office hours queue. It is difficult, it is challenging, it is stressful. Take this class with some friends, and suffer through it together. At the end of the day, though, I definitely come away from the class feeling proud of myself. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is like two classes ' worth of content so account accordingly if you don't have an extraordinary mathematical background like me. I definitely underestimated the workload. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is the first course that I've taken where I truly believe the knowledge I've gained outweighs the grade I received in the course. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is the worst class I've had to take at Stanford. The grading is subjective to whoever is your grader, one may take off way more points than another might. No matter how closely you model your proofs to past proofs you've studied, there will always be issues with it. Be prepared to put every hour of your life into this class if you want to do well 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Try it, but take it seriously. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Try to have proof-writing background before going into this course. The course teaches you the basics (i.e. what is a proof by contradiction) but expects nuances that I did not know, but presumably someone with proof background would have. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Work with a partner, but do your own work (think through the proof on your own) and then work with your partner to write the final proof for the best results. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
You must have a partner on assignments to get a good grade 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
You willl learn so much! Be prepared to work really hard but not always see that reflected in your grades. Ask for help early and rest in the fact that you're learning a ton. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
You’re probably only taking this class because you have to so just get through it. It gets easier over time. 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Your brain will grow so much 
(with Lee, Cynthia B; Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Winter)
Absolutely take this class even if you think you won't like it. It will pay off. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Amazing class. Incredible. But be very prepared to take the time to do everything. Its really, really time consuming (too time consuming tbh) especially if you try to do the whole PSET as recommended. It'll take you a solid 15 hours just to do the weekly PSET (not counting the time to learn and review the material) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Are you really, really sure you want to go into computer science? 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be aware that the workload is very heavy. Also, it's unlike programming where iterating is part of the process. There are only so many opportunities to demonstrate your learning, so be as detail-oriented as possible, and get help whenever you need it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be careful - it takes a lot of time to complete. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be careful, and don't underestimate this class. Harder than cs107 in my opinion. Seriously, your psets will make you tear your hair out but they're crucial for exam performance. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be meticulous. Also, expect to put in a tremendous amount of effort and time and grow a lot intellectually. Keith does a good job explaining the concepts and definitely displays superb passion for the topic, and it certainly is infectious. Expect to often feel disheartened when you see the grades your work earns in proportion to the amount of time you spend on it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be prepared for proofs and learning to write them well in order to do well in this course. Also, plan to attend all lectures, because Keith is a very engaging and animated lecturer. The class is pretty self-contained as a result. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be prepared to invest a tremendous amount of time in this course. Try to make time as much as possible to check over your work either with a partner or a TA if you can. Never, ever get behind, if you can help it, because it is very, very hard to recover from it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be prepared to learn a great deal! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be prepared to spend a lot of time -- like a 107 amount of time. It is interesting though, and you won't be bored 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be prepared to work your ass off. I'm one of those people that believes if you work hard and put in your best effort, good things will happen to you. I think this class embodies it. The class is set up for you to succeed but you must be willing to put in the work. Do not let yourself fall behind. Take 103A to force yourself to review as you go. It makes a big difference when exams happen. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be ready for a tough 10 weeks. You do learn a lot at the end though. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be ready to think a lot. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be ready to think. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Be warned! This is a HARD course. This course is also quite tedious in that one needs to be detail in their proof writing. Yes, there is a lot of writing in this course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Changed how I think. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Claim: Taking CS 103 is a good idea. Disproof: Assume for the sake of contradiction that taking CS 103 is a good idea. This means that some good will come out of taking the class. Consider any arbitrary student x where x is enrolled in CS 103. This means that x will have to take CS 103. Which means that there exists some real number g such g represents x's gpa, that x is prepared to dramatically decrease. By definition, dramatic decrease means a decrease of approximately .2 from the GPA. During the process of taking 103, x will lose all happiness. X will fail most proofs for arbitrarily forgetting to state the word "arbitrary." Good idea is defined by x where x believes taking the class will increase their happiness and only dramatically decrease their GPA. Happiness(x) has decreased and GPA has decreased by a magnitude greater than dramatically. This is a contradiction. We've reached a contradiction, therefore our assumption was incorrect. Taking CS 103 is not a good idea. QED 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
course is a good amount of work - get a pset partner to make it more manageable. a good background in slightly more rigorous math definitely helps you throughout the course. keith starts from the beginning, though, so you don't need experience, but it moves VERY. FAST. oh and follow the proof formats from lecture. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
CS103 is a tough course with a substantial work load. Read over the material that will be covered. If the topics interest you then the course is worth it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
CS103 is not a hard class to understand but it is a hard class to do well in if you have not done proofs before because nobody seems to care about your conceptual understanding of problems, but only about the technicalities of the proof. I got an A in the class, bu hated having to go to office hours to make sure we got every technicality of every proof right when we had the intuition behind the problems the whole time; this also makes it hard to hear Keith talk about caring about the holistic growth of students because it makes him sound like a hypocrite. This is compounded by the fact that the class does not feel all that useful in real life, though it may actually have some applications. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely do it! It'll really get you thinking! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely give it your all and it will reward you back! Also, use the "animated" slide lessons from the website. They're very helpful for some of the trickier topics! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely take it if you are not strong on foundations! Go through the course syllabus and see if there are things you do not know.. If so, go for it:)
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely take it! CS103 is by far my favorite class at Stanford so far. I'm definitely a person who is into theory and this class gave me a great taste of that. In terms of how to do well in the class, make sure you never get behind and work on the psets alone before getting help. Reach out to Keith and or the TAs if you have any questions and just enjoy! :) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely take it! Excellent introduction to proofs, discrete math, and computability theory and complexity theory. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely take it!!! If it were up to me, everyone should take a proofwriting class at some point, so that they can practice the same clarity of thought needed to write good proofs. Work hard, and enjoy, and just read over some of your proofs; you'll find that your own writing is more elegant than you thought :) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely take it. Even if you're not CS, it's a fascinating class. Well worth the struggle. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely worth it! This class really challenged me but by the end of it I've really grown. The class can get really overwhelming if you don't dedicate to it as much time as is necessary, so don't go into this expecting that it won't be a lot of work, because it is. But if you put in the work and really make use of Piazza and the various online tool, you'll find that you learn a lot. Psets are a little tough because it seems that a lot of the points awarded are up to the discretion of the TA grading them, and seems random sometimes, but we can't do anything about that. Either way, the exams are worth a lot more than the Psets and you learn a TON through working on the psets. Overall, would recommend! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Difficult class with a huge workload. Make sure you start the problem sets early. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Do it; it makes you think. Read aha! Gotcha by Martin Gardner first. Will help a lot with comprehension and is fun and short. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Do practice problems and take them to office hours 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't be embarrassed to go to office hours if you get stuck, because you will get stuck. The end of the quarter feels very rushed. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't fall behind towards the end of the quarter, and definitely manage your time so you can go to office hours before the PSET is due every week. Also prepare as best you can for each exam. But in the end, also don't freak out about the grade too much and just reflect on how much you're learning in ten short weeks. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't fall behind! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't get discouraged by the grading; the class is really interesting and it's worth the effort of learning the material--even if it seems like the work isn't paying off for individual proofs or individual psets, it really is paying off in amount of learning. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't let the friendly facade fool you, and don't get too wrapped up in the intellectual beauty of (for example) Cantor's theorem. Memorize proof templates now; there's presumably time for appreciating the material after finishing the class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't take this class. Keith Schwarz is not somebody you want to be having as a lecturer. He makes everything harder than it should be and you don't learn anything at the end. This class has been the worst experience in my life. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't take this one with another computer science course. It's going get crazy.... 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't. Take 154 or take any cs theory class at any community college over the summer. You will learn more and spend less time doing so and stanford is generally liberal with letting you not take this class. This class in many ways is part of why CS continues to be dominated by upper middle class white males as the support structure strongly favor those who have been exposed to similarly structured material in the past (aka proof based math in high school), unlike most of the cs core here which is generally accessible to most backgrounds. I would not be a cs major if I had taken this class early in my cs career here instead of skipping it and doing the rest of the core (including 4 classes which this is allegedly a prereq for). Keith will also lower your score if you ask for regrades. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
dont 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Especially if you are SCPD, just be prepared for a wide range of time commitment possibilities. I spent about 30 hours per week on this course, and YMMV, but that was many more hours than I had predicted at the outset. Also, it's worthwhile to at least familiarize yourself with the idea of mathematical proofs before the class begins, because it moves at a really fast pace. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Find a good partner. This is key to keeping you honest and doing well on the problem sets. Do practice problems. There's a ton of material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Find a group of people to bounce ideas off of when writing proofs 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Find a pset partner. It will make your life easier. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Follow their advice! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
For any student attending office hours in person is the key to this course. If you're an SCPD student, try to go to office hours in person at Stanford as the online offering are poor. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
For many of you reading this, I'd imagine you don't have a choice and that you have to take it for the CS core. For some people, this class is mildly interesting at best, because they simply do not find it as interesting as the math in CS 109. For others, they love this class as their favorite Stanford class. The range of experiences for CS 103 are vast and complex, and I think largely depend on what else you're taking that particular quarter. I took CS 103 and CS 109 at the same time, and found myself straddled between the two. I know that others taking a lighter quarter (during their sophomore and freshman year typically) had a better time because they had the time to focus and hone the skills necessary to be successful in this class. I'd recommend taking the class as soon as you can, even if the material seems scary. You'll be okay! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Go get em! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Go to office hours more. Asking the same question of Piazza vs at Office Hours in-person leads to totally different experiences. On Piazza, I think Keith is so strict on the ambiguity that TAs must respond with on questions that TAs are not helpful AT ALL on Piazza. People will ask questions like "How will this question be graded?" and they will respond "We can't tell you!" So if one just does the PSETs by themselves and asks questions on Piazza accordingly, one will run into dead-ends, and I truly think that, in the beginning of the quarter, when there is a seriously large number of students getting 0-30% of the class getting sub-50% on the PSETs (including me!), it is because the students haven't had feedback on the really nuanced differences that implicate their proofs at the beginning of the quarter. I would recommend doing of the following: join 103A or plan to carve out serious time for going to in-person office hours. 103A is a gold mine where all the people can get their proofs looked over by the TAs in relatively small setting and the TAs are GREAT at office hours. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Go to office hours often! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
good luck

Great class but be ready to do the work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Great course! Challenging and mind-bending but rewarding! Keith is the best. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Great course! Grading can be annoying, but you will learn so much, which is very rewarding. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Great course!! Very challenging, but I feel like I improved as a thinker and gained a higher aptitude for problem solving and greater resilience. Keith is a great teacher of the 103 concepts. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
great course, very strict problem set grading 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Great introduction to mathematical proofs. The course, however, is a lot harder than it needs to be. Too many problem sets to complete in little time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Hard, hard class. There are two types of people who take this class. Some are the people who literally understand everything on a well level and take up about an hour of OH time just to ask about a question worth two points. The other set of people are the kinds that struggle a ton, and you honestly can feel so alone in this class, as if you're the only one struggling through all the percentiles, low PSet grades (the grading of which feels arbitrary), and practice tests that are difficult to navigate. As a person in the ladder group, I can ensure you that you're not alone. This is a class that's meant to be fully embraced, and can take in a significant toll in terms of time and mental energy. It's a super worthwhile journey, and Keith is the best teacher i've had in all of Stanford, but it can be really difficult to go through the course at times. Definitely use OH as a time to figure out proof style, and try to go to OH often or get used to OH as it sometimes feels like a routine. The class both teaches a ton about proof writing and mathematical reasoning, but also, every week is just a new flurry of theory and discrete math that sometimes can be confusing to follow. Just be sure to get pset buddies (partners or not, make sure you have a friend or others to work on the class with), relax, and do your best. I have never felt as tested by a class as I have by 103 (even after taking 107) and definitely, definitely start early. Also dont take this for EE math reqs, or for SymSys if your concentration is not in CS, it's just not worth it even if the journey through can be occasionally rewarding. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Hardest class I have taken. Be prepared to put in the hours. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
have fun! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
honestly i've never devoted so much time and effort in a class yet done so poorly. I'm definitely not blaming Keith or the TAs -- they truly did their best to teach the material as thoroughly as they could and offered many resources to help us digest and practice the material. However, I felt like the abstract theories and intuitions that are necessary for this class just couldn't click in my mind. Perhaps if there were more time to digest the material or just a lesser volume of information taught to us in such a short period of time, I may have been able to better internalize the material and build up the intuition needed to do well on the exams and problem sets 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I do not recommend taking this class unless you're a CS major. The problem with this class is that assignments take way too long, and then even after all your effort, you still get points off for the most trivial of things. Midterms are ok, but the final, at least in our case, was unfairly almost twice as long but still had the same allotment of time. With the exception of a few topics we covered (Turing Machines and Complexity/Computability), I feel this class was not worth the time or effort. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I don't think it's useful trying to finish the pset in one go. Try to first look over the problems just to get a feel for what each problem is asking. Build either some intuition or some questions. Go do something else for a while. Revisit the pset, and hopefully build some rough answers, and keep iterating. If you're stuck, go to a TA/Piazza. Also, it's easy to forget to directly state what you need to prove because it seems that the conclusion follows predictably. But that's just an easy way to lose small points to an otherwise solid proof. Good luck in the class!!! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I love this course! Keith and the TAs put amazingly great amount of efforts to make the materials accessible and fun. And all the resources that I've been exposed to through the course would probably benefit me lifetime. The workload is heavy but is definitely worth it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I totally recommend this class, especially with Keith. It's quite unique among CS classes, and it will expose you to a totally new side of the field, especially if you take it coming out of the 106 series like me. It's just the right amount of hard! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I would not recommend this course if you do not need it for your degree or if you do not have plans to take other courses that depend on it. While I found it very interesting, it was very upsetting and had me very down throughout the entire quarter. The reason is that I put in so many hours every week, went to office hours, and had a good partner to work with yet still did not perform well. This is the first time I took a course where the time spent did not reflect well nor improve my performance. I felt that I understood what was presented in lecture, but the problem sets often have very challenging problems that sometimes can only be solved with help from a TA, unless you are a super genius. Keith goes on and on about those doing well in the course, but I am not sure if he knows how to give constructive advice to those that are not doing well. He recommends reaching out to TAs and himself when you need help, but it seems that the only advice was to reach to the TAs. I did this, but did not feel that I was improving by doing so. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I would recommend the class, but I would tell them to budget a lot of time for the problem sets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
If you have a strong mathematical background, the first 5 weeks might seem trivial, but the second half of the course will most likely surprise you. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
If you like learning, take this class. Having finished the class, I feel like I have a rock-solid foundation in mathematical thinking, and can much more comfortably approach proofs. The problem sets will definitely stretch you, so make sure to get started early. I'm serious. Unlike coding, it's a lot harder to get unstuck when writing proofs. Overall, each aspect of the class felt rewarding, and it was definitely a highlight of the quarter. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
If you're interested in the theory-side of Computer Science, you'll love this class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It is hard, make sure to re-read all of your psets 100 times for errors. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It is one of the best classes I've taken at Stanford. Keith is amazing! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It is such a cool course. If you have never seen proof writing, set theory, or first order logic and these are things you want to learn more about this is an amazing introductory level class! It is truly taught for people who have never seen this stuff. Also the computation theory material is so cool and fun to learn. If you invest a lot into this class you will get a lot out of it! Work hard and try to connect what you're learning to other things in CS, you will see that things connect beautifully. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It may seem hard at first, especially if you aren't good at / have never done proofs before, but you will learn them eventually (hopefully). And once that happens, you begin to realize that the course is actually extremely interesting and applicable to modern CS. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It takes about equal time as a full-time job. If you are in SCPD and don't have that time, don't take the course. SCPD students in Asia with a 9-5 job will be at a huge disadvantage because none of the office hours fall during normal non-work waking hours in Asia. On-campus students rely heavily on office hours to get hints/guidance on the psets, and without that resource you are likely to fail the class unless you already know some/most of the material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It was interesting and useful, but the TAs nitpick on the problem sets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a class that requires a large number of hours of work. The key to conquering it is tons and tons of practice. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a lovely course and if you want an introduction to the math used in computer science, this is the course for you. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a ton of work, and unless you are really into the mathematical side of computing it will be a pain. I didn't get much out of the class because I knew I had to speed through the problem sets as fast as possible to get them in on time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a very interesting course but it's very time consuming, fast-paces, and more challenging than expected. If you don't need it to complete your degree, don't torture yourself and take it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's awesome. It's crazy, but awesome. You'll work hard, but it's absolutely worth it. Math are the bones of CS, and they're really powerful. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's definitely worth taking. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's Hard 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
it's hard, and be prepared to put in a lot of time. if you're taking it with cs 107, it gets very hectic in the last week. otherwise, it's quite doable as long as you aren't taking other hard classes. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's not as bad as people say!!! I didn't even know people thought it was hard, etc, etc until midway through the quarter, and I thought the class was really fun. The problem sets are sort of like brain teasers, which I enjoyed (but start those psets early!). To practice for midterms and finals, just do problems over and over and make sure you understand how to write a proof (honestly, if you know how to set up your proof, things flow from there). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's okay to mess up the first few psets, you'll get the hang of what they want from a proof after a while (read the proof guidline checklists!!) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's possible to take it concurrently with CS109 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
it's pretty hard but you'll make it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
it's so hard 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's very very very easy to fall behind and fail 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's worthwhile but challenging so be sure to take it at a time when you can devote your full attention and efforts to the concepts. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Its hard and a lot of work and will probably piss you off 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Its hard. Be prepared to work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keep up with the work, spend time understanding each topic along the way. If something isn't clicking, get advice from TAs/Keith on what to change about your habits. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keith is a great lecturer, no doubt. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keith is an amazing lecturer and organizes the class very well 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keith is an excellent instructor dedicated to providing his students with ample resources to support their learning. I enjoyed the course immensely, and was amazed by how Keith was able to present every single topic in a way that is at the same time easy to understand and deeply engaging. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
KEITH IS AWESOME. I would definitely recommend taking this class. However, definitely allocate a lot of time for it. It does require a lot of time to understand the material properly. Grading can somewhat be harsh on the problem sets. I would still recommend taking it. The material is really interesting. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keith is maybe one of the best humans you will ever encounter 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
keith is the greatest of all time. You will learn more from this course than any other course at Stanford; you will be challenged in ways you didn't realize possible; and you will walk away amazed at the fact that you can now fully articulate the P vs. NP problem. I took both this course and CS106B with Keith, and I feel absolutely blessed to have had the most caring, wonderful prof teach me the foundations of theoretical CS. I would never have continued with CS had it not been for my amazing experience in his classes--everything, from PSets to lectures to supplementary materials, was so incredibly well-thought-out and useful. please, take this course!! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keith mentioned:" if you are not doing any complexity problems in your work, you'd better change your job." This changes the way how I think. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keith Schwarz is an amazing lecturer and person. The course covers a lot of material, and Keith does a really great job. Get started on the problem sets early though...they are very long. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
keith taught this class very well and it was very interesting, if you put in the time you will get so much out of it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Learn a tremendous amount 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Make sure to leave plenty of time open to work on the problem sets because they require you to think above simply what you learned and instead guide you to discover new concepts. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Make sure you take the time to understand each topic before moving on 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Material is extremely difficult but well-taught. Grading can be harsh and very nit-picky which can be super discouraging. I think those who put in the time and effort definitely get out what they deserve from the class in the long-run, but it's easy to feel like you weren't cut out for the content and that your efforts aren't paying off at times. I think if you push through that and continue to put in the effort, you see the results. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Na 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Need to do all problem set problems yourself. 90% of learning is in psets. Material in lectures tended to be much more easy to understand, but this material gets really 'stretched' and understanding is really gained in psets, and ultimately this is what you're tested on in the 2 midterms + final. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
No way around it this class is extremely hard and very foreign material. The material is interesting at times but the way grading is done is ridiculous, discouraging, and subjective TA to TA. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Only take it if necessary for your major. Otherwise I do not think it is worth the work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Only take this class if you have to for your major. And even then consider how serious you are about this major before taking this class. This is a class that should only be taken if you have to. The grading is extremely harsh and purely subjective, something one TA will say is correct another TA will find incorrect which leads to inconsistent grading and a lack of complete understanding. Miniscule problems like saying "choose any x" instead of "choose any arbitrary x" or "if x and y are adjacent" instead of "choose an x and y that are adjacent" will lead to incorrect answers, which in the case of midterms can lead to getting an entire question wrong. If a proof is set up incorrectly they won't even read the rest of the proof for partial credit and will proceed to mark the entire proof as incorrect. The CS department claims that it has no weeder classes, but this class disprooves such claim. Q.E.D. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Prepare to work hard and be constantly confused by new concepts. This is a rewarding class but realize this is only a notch down from 107 if logic isn't your thing. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Problem sets will take up most of your time in this class, but they won't really affect your grade. Do well on the exams in order to do well in the class. Exams will determine the large bulk of your grade even if you spend much more time on problem sets, so be careful on the tests. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Problems/psets are genuinely a lot of fun if you have even the slightest appreciation for math/logic but the evaluation in this class is a mess. Know that this is a class about PROOFWRITING first and foremost, so be prepared to get zero partial credit if your logic is sound but your proof isn't written in the right way. Go to office hours before submitting anything if you care about grades. Overall incredibly frustrating in the context of academics but genuinely fascinating & enjoyable work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Psets are a pain. Need to know info for a lot of CS / mathematics. Challenging but not too stressful 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Put in effort for the midterms and take the psets seriously 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Read all the handouts and just simple do lots of practice problems 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Requires a lot of abstract thinking 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Some of the assignments may be much more difficult than others depending on your strengths and weaknesses so it is a good idea to begin working on the problem set early to get an idea of how much time it will take. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
start problem sets early! Try and finish 2 days in advance so that you have enough time to check your answers adequately! Also follow proof guidelines and templates to a T! You lose a lot of points on midterms if you do proofs slightly incorrectly 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Start the PSets early and chip away at them; this is good material to let your brain stew over while you go about the rest of your business. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Starts off really tough, but you'll get the hang of it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Starts psets early on or you will struggle 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Stay on top of your problem sets 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it for sure 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it if you have to 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it when you have time to really think through the concepts and assignments, because the PSETs will eat up a lot of your time. I would not take this with CS107 or another time-eating class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it with a light course load! You will need a lot of time for problem sets and to attend office hours to fully grasp this material, especially if you are new to proof writing 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)

Take it! Keith is awesome! But sometimes exams can be a little way too hard! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it, make sure to start psets early and that you have no tiny mistakes in your set 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it. One of the best classes at Stanford. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take the time to understand the concepts because working hard in this course will provide you with very valuable reasoning skills. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take this class and take it with Keith! Keith is a fantastic teacher and makes the class really interesting and fun. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take this class with Keith Schwartz! I know a lot of people despised him after taking 106B, but Keith is very much a theory guy, and his enthusiasm and genuine belief that YOU CAN DO IT is what truly got me through, especially in the first few weeks when I thought this class was hell on earth. Work hard, but also, don't be afraid to go ask for help! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The grading style is hard to satisfy. Make sure you say everything you need to say in your proof, but don't say too much. By the way, I have got points deducted for having one-sentence paragraphs so make sure not to do that either. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The instructor made it extremely hard for no reason. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Very much not useful for you in CS or in any other field. Highly disappointed! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The partner you choose to complete the problem sets with is VERY important. You do not want to have to do the entire problem set when you have projects and exams in other classes, as these are supposed to be partner problem sets. Don't pick one that will take shortcuts and do a sloppy job. Your partner should be focused on this class, not diverted by others. A good measure is how much your partner cares about others; as with romantic relationships, this will be a give-and-take depending on your respective workloads. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The PSETs can get extremely long. It took so so so long to finish some of them. Budget your time, start early and make it your goal to finish as much as possible. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This class is a LOT. I was forced to spend less time and put in less effort for other classes than I wanted to just to scrape by in CS103. The material is interesting for the most part but there is simply too much of it to cram into a single quarter while still taking other classes. If you're really good at juggling academic responsibilities or naturally inclined toward mathematics/logic, then you might be fine in this class. It is undeniably time-consuming but doesn't necessarily have to take over your life. If you're not inclined toward either of those things, or are taking this class for a requirement, then just buckle up and roll with the punches. You will learn a ton but this class truly takes focus, determination, and time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This class is amazing. You truly get what you put into it. Be willing to put in the hours to understand the material. Through the process you will learn a ton. Embrace the difficulty of the problems sets and try to learn and ask as many questions as you can. Keith and the TA's are superb! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This class is incredible difficult. If you do not have a background in discrete mathematics, please set aside the time to understand the problems. This isn't about reading or putting in hours of reading slides; this is about constant practice. Figuring out these problems is very difficult. Good luck. SymSys majors - take Phil150 instead. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This class is really tough in the beginning, and though it stays hard you will get the hang of it and be better at managing the time the class takes. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This class was very difficult. Budget your time well. Don't underestimate this class! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This course was harder than I expected, mostly because the grading is unforgiving on the problem sets yet the feedback is often lackluster. Because of this office hours are often packed, and you're lucky if you can get 5 minutes of feedback for 2 hours of waiting. There is an assumption that working through the psets and practice problems will prepare you for the tests, but I found this not to be the case. Learning the concepts and studying the format of CS103 questions explicitly seems to be the most important for getting a good grade, although I still don't know if that is really the same thing as learning the material in a way you could apply this in your work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is a difficult course no doubt, but an extremely gratifying and rewarding one. Keith and the teaching staff put in a tremendous amount of effort and they want students to succeed. I highly recommend taking the plunge into this course, even if it will be your first course in formal proof-based mathematics. You will leave this course with a structured way of thinking that will have positive side-effects in nearly any discipline. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is a really great course. It is undeniably hard and time consuming, but the return you get from the time you spend is very high. Keith is a great instructor and the support he provides is very accessible so there are rarely moments when you feel you have nowhere to go for help. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is a really interesting course, and extremely well taught. It is also a lot of work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is a tough class--do not underestimate it. I found it almost as difficult as CS 107. Try to take a proof-based math class of some kind before you take this one; otherwise, you'll likely find that there is too much material, at too high a difficulty level, graded too harshly. Additionally, see if you can find a partner for the PSETs before you start. Having a good partner makes a world of difference. That said, the content is fascinating, and Prof. Schwarz is a great teacher. You will learn so much in this class if you take it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is an amazing class with an excellent teaching staff. The class requires a good amount of work and was moderately difficult, but still somehow fun. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is an amazing course. If you come in and treat it as such -- and let yourself be excited about every part of it, you will love the material and really learn it. Don' t be afraid to reach out for help anytime -- the instructors are incredible. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is an exceptionally well taught class. It gives a rigorous and speedy introduction to theoretical mathematics and computer science, with so many options and resources for help. Keith is so approachable and just going to class makes my day brighter. Having taken theoretical math classes and been thrown completely into the deep water with proof writing, it was so nice to see that there is a way to teach it, and I'm really glad that the CS department is doing that. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is more work than the 5 unit designation would make you think. You'll learn a lot but you have to stay on top of it. Buckle down and be ready. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is not a blow off class in any sort of way, but it's really valuable. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Those who knew what was going on here must make way for those who know little. And less than little. And finally as little as nothing. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Tough class, heavy workload but instructors and TAs want you to succeed, so lots of resources to succeed. You get what you put into it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Try to get excited about the computer theory at the end of the quarter, or it will start to feel really long. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Understand everything, don't let your partner do all the work, because you won't understand future topics. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Very helpful and insightful 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Very useful as a foundation course since it covers so much material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
While Keith is a very good instructor, I feel like the course is taken too seriously for what it's worth, especially if you compare the workload and expected level of rigor on psets and tests versus similar courses at other universities. I do not feel like focusing on the semantics of sentences should be the core of this class. Overall very discouraging and disappointing. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Worth it but allot a good amount of time for it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
You are going to have to work very hard, but it's rewarding! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
You have to go to office hours if you have never done this type of math before. Keith excepts excellence which puts a lot of pressure on students, especially if this is your first go 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2017/2018, Autumn)
10/10 would recommend, even if you don't think you like math it's a very accessible course. While it moves fast, you definitely don't need to be a maths wiz in order to be a part of this class and to understand what is going on. Learning about turing machines and the nature of computation is very rewarding, but I think the journey itself is the ultimate win. Hopefully this class will inspire you to work harder and engage with the material, and get genuinely excited about something for the first time in a long time.I learned how to think systematically and analytically about a lot of things (and not just math!) Sometimes when I'm talking to other people I'll start breaking down something they said into first order logic, or try to explain something to them like I'm writing a proof, and it's definitely helped clear up some communication fuzziness which has been really cool. Another thing that I think I learned during this class was the importance of working hard. I've always been a B, B- CS student, but I could really see the work that I put into 103 paying off and I'm hoping to harness what I learned about trying hard, asking lots of questions and preparing for things in advance to use in my future classes. Finally, I became so much more comfortable with my role/identity as a person in STEM. I always felt like a slightly sub-par student who was more talented in the humanities than in math or engineering, which in part stemmed from our cultural ideas of 'innate talent' or 'genius'. While I'm sure that there is some factual basis for these ideas, I think that they can trap students into an 'all or nothing' mentality where if you're not doing good in a certain field you don't think you can ever do well. However, a lot of the anecdotes that Keith brought up during lecture focused upon the importance of hard work and you could tell he genuinely believed in his students ability to improve if they weren't doing so well already, and that was really inspiring to me, and I ended up improving, and now I feel a lot more like I deserve to be a CS major and to learn what a lot of people don't think I can learn.A lot of people enter CS103 with this expectation that it's going to be really hard--and it is, but I think it's also very rewarding as well. I would highly suggest going to office hours because they can be really helpful, but I think the most helpful thing is to focus on learning the material instead of just getting through it. A lot of people treat the problem sets as something that they should divide up and try to finish as quickly as possible, but while your grade working by yourself might not be as good as if you work with a partner, I think that the struggle of having to do things on your own will pay off in the long run. Definitely take the practice exams, and definitely block off 15 hours each week to do the psets. Sometimes I'd look at a pset and feel a little burst of panic because I had no idea how to solve any of the problems. Later on, I came to realize that if I did know how to solve all of the problems at first sight, I should clearly not be taking this class. It's normal to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out, and if you just put in the required 15 hours I'm sure you'll arrive at a solution in the end. A great deal of learning happens while solving the pset, so it's important to treat it with the same intentionality and openmindedness as you would lecture, instead of expecting to come in and know everything. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
A demoralizing course 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
A lot of time commitment but Keith and the TAs are wonderful 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
again, stay on top of definitions 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Although this course is pretty tough, it is extremely worth the struggle. If you put in hard work you will learn a great amount of really interesting information. Do not be discouraged on the problem sets when you do not get the scores that you would necessarily hope for. They are notoriously hard with grading the PSETS. Take the feedback that they give you and use it to help you grow. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Amazing class, take it with Keith! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Avoid it if you can, or at least wait until they fix all of the logistical issues, which will be elaborated on in the other comments question. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Be prepared to feel like this course is different from anything you've done in the past. If you expect to get perfect grades on the psets like you might have in most past classes, you might want to tweak those expectations, especially if this is the first time you're ever encountering proofwriting or discrete math in general. A word to the wise: the number of points you can lose for the style of your proof (e.g., saying "any" instead of "an arbitrary") and not adhering to a very strict template is unbounded. That is, you can write a 1 page proof whose logic is basically right and get just as many points as someone who wrote literally nothing on the page. It's fairly demoralizing, but just be prepared for that.Be proactive. This is not a class where you can skip lecture or borrow notes from friends and cram before the exam to do well. You'll be best served if you actually hunker down and do the work, asking questions on Piazza and attending (oftentimes congested) office hours. This is a class that is full of great content, and absorbing it fully is really, really rewarding if you put the time and effort in.This is definitely a tough question, but as soon as we started getting near the end of the course and using everything we'd learned so far to reason about the limits of computing and arrive at some pretty grand truths (there are things that are true but are not provable), every lecture was pretty mindblowing! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Be prepared to give it your all. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Be prepared to put in a lot of work, this class goes 100 MPH from lecture 0 to 26 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Be prepared to put your all into it--try your best on the psets, start them early, go to class. You'll learn a lot. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Be prepared to spend more time making your proof "rigorous" than actually understanding the concepts. The graders are both arbitrary and harsh on the psets and exams to the point where you could understand the material perfectly, but if your proof isn't well-written then you receive virtually no credit for conceptual understanding. Doing well in the course tests more on how well you can write formally than understanding the actual concepts.Be prepared to understand the material and concepts well, then lose arbitrary points on your formal proofs by graders to the point where you virtually get the entire problem wrong. Doing well on psets and exams is more a test of how "rigorous" your proof writing can be than you actually understanding the concepts completely. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Be wary of how harshly graded the problem sets are. In order to do well, you must check with lots of other people or attend office hours vigorously. Other than that, this was one of the most interesting classes I have taken so far at Stanford and I really loved the math covered in it. I just wish it wasn't so difficult to get only 2/3 on the problem sets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Best class I've ever taken at Stanford! This is the first time that I can say I genuinely looked forward to lectures. I imagine it might not be as interesting if you have a strong background in proofs, but for me this was my first exposure to proofs and computability theory of any kind. Would recommend to non-CS majors as well. Can't say enough good things about Keith; he absolutely wants everyone to succeed and feel confident, and not once did he answer a question with condescension of any kind, which I really appreciated. I found it really helpful to do PSETs on my own, though you're given the option to do it in pairs. It meant more caffeine-fueled late nights, but I don't think I would have learned the material as well any other way.My favorite thing that we learned was Cantor's theorem to show that the cardinality of a set is always strictly less than the cardinality of its power set. I found this super cool because the proof was very clever but accessible, and because it made me see that we can reason about degrees of infinity mathematically even if its hard 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
building intuition is super important and that comes from seeing a lot of proofs, emulating them, and then doing them 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Careful on the tests 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
CS 103 is a must-take for all Stanford students, regardless of your discipline. Keith is an incredible lecturer, and you don't want to miss out on his teaching! Plus the formal reasoning you learn in the course stimulates parts of the brain that other math, STEM, and humanities classes don't always access. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
CS103 is an interesting course, and Keith is a really engaging lecturer. I learned a lot about proof-writing and basic theoretical computer science, neither of which I knew anything about before. My only complaint is that grading can sometimes seem unnecessarily picky (graders will take off a lot of points for little things like small wording issues, even if the bulk of a proof is correct). I also disliked that Keith was very unwilling to talk about exam points: for instance, when I lost points on an exam question, I asked Keith what those points were for (i.e., what specific things was my answer missing that needed to be included in the correct answer?). He was very unwilling to answer my question, saying that talking about points "wouldn't be productive." Ultimately, he did not answer my question, which disappointed me. While I agree that overall comprehension of the material is ultimately more important than a few points on an exam, understanding exactly why I lost points in a specific place would have helped me better understand why I got the question wrong. Moreover, it would have helped me understand why my error on this particular exam question was worth the number of points that were taken off. Other than the concerns that I've outlined above, I have no complaints about CS103. Keith is a very good lecturer, and I learned a lot from his lectures and his slides. I also appreciated the large number of resources (extra problems, practice exams, and guides) that were given out throughout the quarter. Overall, I appreciate what I've learned in CS103, and it is a class that I would recommend to any other student considering CS. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
CS103 is wonderfully taught and very interesting! Make sure to start PSets early. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Definitely take it, but take it with friends and go to office hours 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Definitely take it, it is some of the most fun and eye-opening math you will ever do! But make sure you have the time to give this class the dedication it deserves. Problem sets take several hours and doing them in one night is not a good idea if you want to succeed and learn the material.The way we did first order logic was kind of a drag (translating and negating is difficult and monotonous) but I definitely see why it's necessary! Maybe talk to the PHIL150 professor and check out some of the exercises he uses on propositional and first-order logic—I enjoyed those a bit more. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Definitely take this class! CS 103 is certainly the best class I've ever taken during my three years at Stanford. And Keith is the best teacher/lecturer I've ever had. The p-sets for this class were extremely fun and stimulating - and I would recommend working on them with a partner (it makes it fun and creates a great support system). Also, make full use of Office Hours - the TA's do a great job of guiding you towards the correct answer without giving any details away (Ivan and Shalom were particularly good TAs). The practice exams and actual exams were really fun as well - and you should definitely do all the practice exams! Both the discrete math and computability and complexity theory parts of the class are amazing - I hope you're looking forward to this class. Every human being should take it.I learnt about very important concepts in discrete math. I also learnt important theorems related to those concepts. I learnt how to prove theorems correctly, concisely and elegantly. I also learnt some amazing concepts in computability and complexity theory, and I learnt how to do computations on theoretical computational models. I learnt how to prove interesting results related to computational theory.Go to all the lectures - don't miss a single one if you can help it. Start the problem sets early - they take a really long time, because they really require you to think. You need to start early enough so you have sufficient time to go to Office Hours and act on the TA's feedback. Pay attention to style - try to constantly learn from the detailed style feedback the TAs give. Always treat every piece of feedback in this class as part of the learning experience; if not, you'll feel resentful and demoralized. Do every practice exam, especially for the final. The format is almost identical to the actual exam. Also, definitely attend the mock exams.I really liked learning about how DFAs, NFAs, regular expressions and right liner grammars work. It was super interesting to see how every regular language could be expressed as all four - and it was even cooler to learn how to interconvert between the four. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Definitely take this course! The subject matter is interesting, the material is taught well, and the Psets are both fun and challenging 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Definitely take this course. It is entirely worth it. It's a lot of work - the psets are long, due weekly and are graded very harshly, and there are two midterms - but you learn SO much and Keith is an INCREDIBLE teacher. definitely take it with him. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)

(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Good class, not too difficult, hard grading. It was honestly better to learn by reviewing the lecture slides rather than sitting through a full 80 minute lecture. If you're into theoretical stuff then you'd like this class.

Great overview of CS theory 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Honestly, I hate to say it--but don't take it unless you need to take it. Really tough, and felt very nitpicky. Was a good class and I learned a ton, but at a high cost of time and stress. Psets are so long that it feels unreasonable to ask someone to do them in one week. When you finish one you are already behind on the next. If you split them with a partner you miss out on skills you need, so it is a lose-lose. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
I feel bad for you if you have to take this with Keith. He has good slides but he's very unforgiving and unfair. Only take it if you have to. Seriously. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
I really dislike this class standalone for those who have never done this sort of math before. I feel that it's very much dominated by those who have some experience in it- and it's unnecessarily intimidating. For those just learning how to write proofs, CS103A is a really helpful class, and I recommend supplementing with that. Make sure to utilize all resources, as the online handouts are always the most helpful, and even when it seems like the only material available is the material given in this class, that's not true- Wikipedia, Sipser, other textbooks, and other universities also cover similar material, because sometimes it's better to see things written or explained in a different way. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
If 154 is being offered in the same quarter and you've done proof-writing before, consider taking that instead 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
If it isn't a requirement, take some other more rigorous proof writing class and just read the Sipser book 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
If you can avoid it, do avoid it. The class focuses too much on proof structure instead on focusing more on actual reasoning. Grading seems arbitrary and even if you run everything down with TAs do not expect anywhere near a perfect grade on the PSETS 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
If you can take any other logic class in place of this one, do. This class focuses on syntax rather than learning. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
If you have a strong math background, look into CS 154 instead. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
If you haven't proved anything before, this is a good course. If you have, the formulaic nature of the proofs of this course will bother you, and I'd recommend just skipping to 154. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)

It's a fun class. Just be aware there are a few bs aspects. Namely, grading on assignments and exams can seem a bit arbitrary or harsh on really small things. But other than that, great class!

It's a great class! Keith is top-notch instructor! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's a great course - go to office hours, and make sure you know the standard of rigor for proofing early or they will tear you up. Very enjoyable, very different from other math classes. Keith is AMAZING, even if he does go quickly. Honestly a great class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's a hard class, but Keith makes it very doable. Don't forget to account for the amount of time that the psets take, they'll likely dominate the end of your weeks. That being said, I truly feel like I learned an exceptional amount from this class and can speak with more precision no doubtKeith really makes this material fun. It's no doubt difficult material, but you end up blazing through it because he explains it so clearly and thoughtfully. Make sure to put in time on the PSets, it's how you'll learn. Also don't worry if you were torn apart on the first pset, it happens to everyone and you'll improve! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's A LOT of effort, but a very well-taught, interesting course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's a lot of work, but Keith is great and you'll definitely learn a lot, even if you have to suffer a bit in the process. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's a lot. Take it with a lighter class load because it will take you 15-20 hours a week. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's a prereq 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's a really interesting class, and learning how to write proofs is useful 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's hard -- the final was very difficult -- but take it if you wish to learn more about math proofs and the intersection of math and CS. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's hard to get help at office hours. I think TA's are conditioned to believe that students are just asking for the answers when they go to office hours, so they're reluctant to give actual helpful advice when approaching problems because they don't want to "give it away." But when you're struggling and honestly don't understand a concept, this is very frustrating. I'd recommend going to see Keith and doing as many practice problems as you can to keep up 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's hard, for everyone, period. Just learn. Don't worry about grades. They honestly grade oddly because they are trying to reinforce how rigorously they want you think through these questions - all good but yes, grades can be tough in this class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's just amazing how everything builds up. People say taking with Keith would make the course harder (which I don't know because I took with Keith), but I think Keith teaches this course so well that in fact, everyone should take with Keith. I'm personally not a fan of Keith, but I have to admit that he teaches this course so well. At the end, about week 9~10, you'll realized that you learned everything in week1~8 to be able to understand the materials that are covered in week 9~10, and it feels great when you realize that. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
It's really time consuming!!

Its a great class. Midterms are easy, the final is a killer. So be prepared. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Its alot of work. Most of the material is interesting, but its incredible challenging and time consuming. Definitely one of the hardest courses I've ever taken, not to mention one of the courses that stressed me out/lowered my morale the most. Be very mindful going in!

(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Keith is an incredible lecturer -- he really makes the material come alive no matter what he's talking about. The class might get you down sometimes with the strict proofwriting guidelines, but I've found every point I've been deducted does have an understandable reason behind it. And the high you get after solving a difficult problem (plus just being in Keith's presence every week) makes it all worth it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Know from the offset this is a *theoretical* math class. Concepts are interesting, but not necessarily directly applicable. Expect to spend a lot of time on homework 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Know that the proofwriting style in this class is different from math classes and is very rigid, so it pays off to put in the time to learn their ways, even if you already know how to write proofs. Otherwise, spend the time to methodically go through each pset since each they prepare you very well for the exams. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure that you have the time and determination to focus on this class. I would not recommend taking many other hard or intensive classes while attempting to do well in this class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure to go to class and try to ask a lot of questions. Also know that you should start psets really early and you should definitely work with a partner to bounce ideas off each other 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure to think very early on about the details of proofwriting - for me I underestimated how rigorous it was for a long time 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure to write proofs in the form they want you to use 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure you are prepared for the problem sets. If you are prepared for the problem sets, then you are more than not prepared for the final exam. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure you have at least 20 hours to burn a week if you take this class. It helps with nailing down formal reasoning, but often it seems much too rigorous than is necessary. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure you have detailed answers. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure you stay on top of psets, they can be very time consuming. The latter half of the class (automata) was much more interesting in my opinion. Make sure your proof writing skills are solid for the first midterm, not being precise even though you know how to solve the problem could land you zero points on a question. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Make sure you understand that this is a course about proof-based math, and prepare accordingly. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
No. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Not a good intro to proofs if that is what you are looking for. However, it is pretty well put together but doesn't seem very productive to learning 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
office hours aren't that useful. pset/exam grading is strict but exams are much easier than psets. lectures can be mildly boring, but slides are very useful. work on psets with a partner 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
One of my favorite classes at Stanford so far. Amazingly well taught and organized, and the material is both fun and challenging. Definitely takes up a lot of time (you could easily spend 15 hours on the problem set each week), but the structure makes it easy to plan and manage, and I never found it particularly overwhelming. It is a theory class, so while there aren't many direct applications to coding, it teaches you a whole new framework for logical and mathematical thinking, which I find really valuable moving forward in computational fields. Like many classes, it's easy to fall behind though, so be sure to stay on top of reading the lecture slides each week and always start the problem sets early. (Never start them the day before. Just don't do it.) And pay attention to the proofwriting guidelines during the first couple of lectures! If you use Keith's proofs as examples when writing your own, you'll save yourself from a lot of the grade markdowns in the first couple problem sets. Work hard, don't overload yourself, and take advantage of one of the best CS core classes!Start the PSET's as early as you can, then chip away at them a little by little throughout the week. They will always take longer than you expect. Make sure you always do the problems on your own even if you're working with a partner, but talking to other students in the class can really help you think about a problem from another perspective if you're stuck. If you're having trouble formalizing your arguments and getting marked off, use the proofs from lecture as examples and pay attention to feedback on your homework and exams! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Pay attention to the details of the work you submit. Your grade will not be determined by your grasp on the higher-level concepts.

Really engage in the material! It's challenging diving into a pset at first but so rewarding when everything clicks. Also, the course moves very quickly, and you really get to see how far you've come once you take a step back 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Really pay attention to the guides to proofs 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
same thing i said earlier lol sry 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Small mistakes add up in this class; while losing a point here or there doesn't seem huge, enough of them can seriously hurt. So make sure to double and triple check your psets! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Spend a lot of time on the class really understanding the material and the feedback you receive. It will be a lot and it will be very difficult to understand at times (especially in the end of the class) but there is a lot of structure in place to help you. Definitely stay on top of the material and ask for help whenever you need it.I never thought that I could reason mathematically and proofs/theoretical math seemed like something outside of my capability. This was my first introduction to this form of thinking, and I really enjoyed the friendly and not too overwhelming introduction.Keep up with the material! It can be a lot but if you make sure you stay on top of it, there is a lot of support in place to help you succeed. The second half of the class is significantly more difficult than the first so make sure you don't get behind on the material. Office hours are key and the class does take A LOT OF TIME. However, if you put in all the work, it is really worth it. The grading is a little harsh and arbitrary at times, but if you really pay attention to the feedback you receive, it's very doable.

(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Start Psets early. Don't use late days. Live in office hours. Your grade in this class is not correlated with how much you understand the material nor how much time you put into the class. You can work your butt off and understand everything from lecture/psets and still get rekt on midterms/final

(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Start the PSets early, so that you can go to office hours if you get stuck on anything! Also, be very careful to make sure you're not accidentally assuming things/misusing terms in your proofs. Learn LaTeX for the first PSet, and it'll save you a lot of time during the quarter.Make your proofs as rigorous as you can (make sure you're not assuming things, or misusing terms accidentally), while keeping in mind that the best proofs are often also relatively short. As some examples of misusing terms, the word 'theorem' can't be used for things you're disproving, and you can't say 'assume the empty set' because an assumption is a strong mathematical statement typically used when we don't explicitly know that something is true in all cases. (In this case, prefer 'consider the empty set'.) A lot of points are taken off for stuff like this, so be careful! Otherwise, this is a brilliant class, and probably taught me the most out of all the classes I've taken here so far. if you think about the implications of each result you derive, it's actually pretty mind-blowing.Turing machines, and unsolvable problems! Growing up during the technological boom, we're imbued with this mindset that, given enough power/hardware/ingenius programming, computers could do anything. There are also always articles in the news about what computers can now do, etc. So it was really fascinating to see what they *can't* do, and how they're modeled mathematically.

(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Take it! But be sure to pay attention, work hard, and do it with a light quarter -- it can be a very difficult class. I thought it was much harder than CS107, though not quite as time consuming. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Take it! It's a tough class, but you will learn so much it's astonishing. Keith is also a wonderful and enthusiastic lecturer who will get you really excited about the material. Moreover, all the TAs are really nice and supportive, and will help you clarify any material you are shaky on.I learned a great deal from this class- I learned how to write rigorous mathematical proofs and reason about problems in a more logical way. But more than that, this class got me really excited about the nature of infinity and the limits of computability. I have learned so much about set theory, different languages, automata, Turing Machine's, and N and NP problems- all topics that I knew nothing about before taking this course! I know I won't get a good grade on this course, but I don't regret taking CS103 at all because of all the knowledge I gained!CS103 is a challenging class that requires a lot of time, so make sure you have enough space for it in your schedule! On that note, start your psets early. I can't stress this enough. The class moves at a very fast pace, so make sure to clarify any material you are shaky on early on, and this includes proof writing style. You can get the intuition behind a problem, but the way you phrase this intuition is just as important. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Take it! Keith is amazing and it will change the way you look at problems and how you can go about solving them. Honestly, I think this class taught me more about how and why we compute than 107, even though 107 is about why computers work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Take it! Keith is AMAZING, and you'll learn to think in ways that you didn't know existed. I thought I stopped liking math after taking calculus in high school, but this really made me change my mind. It's a lot of work, but it's so worth it for the learning you get. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)

Take other classes that teach you how to write proofs (including induction), logic courses, automata courses before you take this "introductory" class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Take this class because it teaches you a lot of interesting things about some of the mathematics behind computer science. Don't fret about the grade because a lot of the TAs don't know math and just grade based on their arbitrary standards.

The class covers many important CS concepts but in terms of problem solving it is quite dull. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
The class is very well organized and taught. Section leaders are good, and Keith is the highlight. Seems like he rehearses each lecture to make it go smoothly, concisely, and make the most sense, and in addition, he is just articulate and interested in many things, so he can convey ideas and why they matter pretty well. Recommended, but is tricky and grading can get really nitpicky. Pay attention to every little piece of your homework, because it gets hard. You'll definitely learn a lot and the content is very interesting, especially for a math class. Recommended, but be prepared. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
The class will take up a lot of your time and the proofs are graded very strictly and harshly. In many problems I had the correct insight yet still got no points due to not writing my proofs in the form they wanted. That said, you'll see many interesting and powerful results regarding the nature of infinity and you'll feel like you really learned a lot and improved by the end of the quarter.Be aware that the class is very focused on the proof format and style, moreso than the actual insights. As someone who already had experience writing proofs, I still lost many points at the beginning due to not expressing everything like they wanted. Be prepared to conform to their standards. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
The course is a great deal of work but you will be proud about what you'll accomplish at the end. You'll probably get frustrated by how well everyone does -- it seems like you need to get a perfect score on every problem set to do well in the class -- but hang in there. The pickiness in the grading on the psets can be frustrating but you get used to it.

The first half of the course teaches intentionally simple material so that the problem sets can focus on teaching you proof techniques. Because of that, the grading is very harsh and you will likely lose a lot of points for simple mistakes even though you understand the material very well so make sure you go to office hours!The first half of the course teaches intentionally simple material so that the problem sets can focus on teaching you proof techniques.

The second half of quarter has a very steep learning curve and the material can be very confusing. Be prepared. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
The TAs were really awful and their grading system seemed to be very inconsistent. I'm not sure how much of this is/was Keith's fault, but he wasn't very helpful either. There was only one TA available for office hours at every session, which would have been OK had there not been 20 students (whom the TAs insisted upon helping individually instead of in groups of people who had the same question) at every session. This all combined to make it very hard to get extra help in the course, which was frustrating because the material was so interesting.

Think strongly about balancing this with easier classes. The first half and second half are extremely different--you may like the material in the first half but not in the second. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class is A TON OF WORK. To be quite frank, the problem sets are WAY TOO LONG and very, very difficult. Unless you have time to really focus on this class as your sole hard class of the quarter, expect to be very stressed about it. The units absolutely do not at all reflect how much work this class is. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class is an incredible amount of work. The psets are very long and on occasion frustrating, although often there are a few cool problems which make up for it. By the end you'll feel really equipped to handle proofs that are thrown at you (mostly those of very specific forms, though). Be ready to have your writing held to very high standards. But make no mistake, the concepts you learn in this class, especially at the end, are very, very cool!I think functions were just generally uninteresting to me - they were a fairly general way of describing something we already knew a lot about, and there were only really 5 or 6 properties we proved about them, which we then proved over and over again. That also applies to binary relations, although those problems were at least somewhat more interesting and varied, and equivalence classes (as briefly as we touched on them) were cool.Allow a lot of time for the psets and be very careful in your wording! They're incredibly picky. My advice is to find the form of the proof you're trying to do online in the slides somewhere and copy it over word for word, tweaking what you need to make it fit the result you're trying to prove. Also, definitely find a PSet partner, it will make everything far easier and you will probably learn a lot from the way they approach the problems (and the mistakes of yours that they catch). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class is really not about math. It's a proof writing class and grading is really pedantic with regards to it. Midterms are mostly trivial problems that have been done in class, but grading is really tough on how you write your proofs. IMO, that's not what this course should be. However, once you let that premise hold, it's a good class. Honestly, very disappointed with the teaching style. Teaching quality is great though. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
this class is ridiculous in terms of grading. The grading is so picky and they literally search for points to take off and they give 0 partial credit. other than that its super interesting and i actually enjoyed the material but i feel so much less confident in my abilities now because even when i thought i did well id get like max 75% on the exams. take a very light load 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class is tedious and probably a waste of your time if its not required. The TAs grade as though they get handed a $100 for any and all errors they find in your homework. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class is time consuming and a lot of work, but also really really interesting. It's a shame that the grading doesn't seem to reflect understanding of material very well 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class is very difficult if you haven't done mathematical proofs before, but extremely rewarding as you learn how to do them from scratch. I came in knowing nothing and learned so much. It took a lot of work, but everything is extremely well taught and it is the best place to learn this stuff. Taking this class with Thinking about the Universe was very rewarding because there are interesting applications of material in 103 when discussing multiverses in that class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class is very interesting, but you will need to dedicate a lot of time to really understanding the material 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This class was pretty good, but I'm not sure why it's so universally well-liked. The computability lectures were fascinating, but many of the earlier set-theory and proof-writing lectures were significantly less interesting, and the problem sets often felt somewhat repetitive and long-winded. If you haven't done any proof-writing before, it's probably pretty good though. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This course is amazing. One of my favorite courses I have taken at Stanford. Make sure to study for the final though. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This is a great class - especially as a first intro into proofwriting and the broader world of mathematics. Keith makes it pretty challenging and pushes you to really drill in the concepts with the PSETs. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This is a hard course - do the problem sets with a partner, and make sure to go to office hours. Also do the readings beforehand - yes, it's hard to make time for them, but it makes the course many many times easier and you will do yourself a massive favour when problem sets come around. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This is a really fun class! The topics are inherently interesting to anyone who likes math/CS and the instructor is awesome at making the topics even more interesting than they actually might be otherwise. Just get really good at ensuring that your proofs are fully technically bulletproof, and you're bound to have a great time.Don't be afraid to go to office hours or randomly show up to CS103A! They're all really helpful! Also- extensively make sure that you're not missing any technicalities in your proofs! It may make sense to you, but if it doesn't make sense according to rigorous, technical analysis, you will lose points. With experience and learning from your mistakes, preventing these point losses get easier and easier 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
This is one of the best classes I've ever taken. Extraordinarily well-taught, well-paced, and well-organized. Even though the material is so advanced, the class still manages to feel very accessible and reasonable. The material is also so fascinating and will frankly make you feel like a genius! You'll be a better computer scientist and also a smarter and more interesting human being.Some of the more technical graph proofs (using definitions like injective, surjective, cover set, independent set, etc.) were less compelling to me. Although I appreciated the effort to show the real-world applications (like the p-set that asked what a cover set would symbolize if the nodes were intersections in a city, etc), the proofs themselves inevitably felt dry and technical.

work hard! They like to nitpick the grading, but, in the end, it makes you a more careful student. Spend a lot of time reviewing psets and study a lot for tests 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
Work with a partner on the problem sets! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
you learn a lot, but the cost is too high. i am not the norm, most people got the material faster than i did, but it took over my life in an unhealthy way and i still never felt good about my performance. the fact that it's so challenging makes people rise to the occasion, but looking back i just can't reconcile that with how much so many people i know in the class struggled and hated the amount of work it was so much. idk if there's a way to cover less material or maintain rigor and high standards without as many sheer hours having to go into it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
You learn a ton, but it's a frick ton of work. Keith's a great lecturer, but his refusal to accept that points are important to students is very annoying. Go to lectures, always check psets at office hours, practice exams are very useful, spend time on your cheatsheets! Take notes in class preferably with colors so keep engaged.Functions and binary relations. All the bijection, euclidean, equivalence stuff was pretty formulaic after a few of those problems and on the practice midterms/ actual midterms those problems really didn't take ant thinking. Just prove for example a strict order is reflexive and transitive and every time you assume the same things to prove the same things.Every pset requires office hours. Sometimes its literally because of ambiguous wording will lead you to the wrong place unless you ask. Just always ask about your approach / proof for every question because invariably you will have overlooked something or you would have gotten points off for something structural even if your proof was right. Better just to make sure beforehand because grading is super (**super) nit picky on problem sets. Don't skip lectures, especially towards the latter half. Do the extra practice problems and practice midterms. They can really take you from feel unprepared and like you can't maths to being pretty confident on the exams, which are actually very reasonable and honestly there's plenty of time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
You might not do well in this class even if you work hard and go to office hours. The concepts are very complex and the grading for this class is pretty rigurous, so don't get discouraged. But you will learn a lot, so it's worth it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
You should take this class. I find it invaluable, albeit painful (it's akin to being pushed into a cold shower while you're still enduring the remnants of sleep). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
You will learn so, so much! Be prepared to put in work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
You'll likely either enjoy keith, or he'll drive you crazy with his annoying words of encouragement and his frustrating enthusiasm. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Spring)
103 is an incredibly rewarding experience, as it's both extremely well-taught and the material is fascinating and really helpful. 103 will make you a more rigorous thinker, and I've found that it's helped me out a lot in thinking about other non-CS aspects of my life. Office hours are excellent, and the problem sets do a good job of developing important skills. Doing the entire problem set (even if you have a partner) is critical for doing well on the exams. The pset grading is fairly strict, unfortunately. But Keith is a very inspirational figure as a teacher and offers excellent life advice. The time you invest in CS103 is worth it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
A great class. Take it! Be on top of the material. Get started on assignments early. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Amazing class! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Ask for help if you ever need it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be comfortable with math proofs or it is best not to take this course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
be persistent. the material is muhc easier if you review constatnly 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be prepared to explore the logical underpinnings of mathematics, put in a lot of time for problem sets and office hours. It is a highly demanding course, but also exceptionally rewarding at the end of the quarter. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be prepared to learn many really interesting things in very little time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be ready for a wide variety of topics in the course. There are areas where there are concrete right/wrong answers and other times where the course can get very philosophical/theoretical. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be ready to devote a huge amount of time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be ready to put in at least 20 hours a week. I should have taken advantage of office hours more. If you are stuck on a problem from the problem set, ask for help because most likely you are missing something. I spent way too long struggling alone when I should have asked for help. Most importantly, don't get discouraged when you think you will never be able to figure out certain problems. Sometimes I needed to think about a problem for a few hours before solving it, but after that process, I learned a ton and was very proud of myself for figuring it out. I learned a bunch of things that I thought I never would have been able to learn, and if I had quit, that would have been true. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be ready to work very hard. This material is very intuitive to some people and very foreign and difficult for others (me). Don't be afraid to ask for help. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Be very careful about how you word things 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Both required and recommended. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Broaden the thinking process and how to approach problems when solving them 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Budget a lot of time for this course, because the material is presented in a very fast-paced way, so getting behind is easy to do but makes it much harder to learn, consolidate your knowledge, and do well in the course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Class has a lot of material, definitely work in groups of three. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Collaborate and start ahead of time on the psets 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
CS 103 is a class that can be applied to understanding computer science, but is actually very separate from other 106/107 series. They relate, but one is definitely not a prerequisite to the other. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
CS103 is very very well taught and teaches a lot of theory in a short amount of time. You come out with a lot of knowledge for only 10 weeks. So far, its one of my favorite courses I've taken at Stanford. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
definitely do it. there little other opportunities to get such a broad and well-taught foundation to so much in mathematics 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Definitely take it. It'll make you a more organized teacher, and everyone should experience Keith at least once in their life. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Definitely try it. It's a special domain of knowledge that has been super interesting to me. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Definitely worthwhile -- it's a whirlwind, but you'll learn a lot and (if you stay on top of the material) have fun doing it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do as many problems as you can and take notes on all the definitions. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do be willing to work hard, and learn A LOT! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do it, its a fun and interesting class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do not take a heavy course load with this class! It's extremely difficult and will require lots of extra time spent on PSets. Also, consider taking it with friends-- those who you know for sure you work well with. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do the CS103 Problem Sets, and go into office hours. One of the things about this course is there is this common theme of "just do more problems". I agree this is true. But one thing that is easy to gloss over is that in other courses like coding courses, you get direct feedback every time you do something; you just hit compile. However, in this class, it's not the same. The only way to get that immediate feedback is to go to office hours before and have the TA's say "can you read this proof, am I doing this the right way?" 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do the PSETS on your own then meet with your group to go over them. That way you learn the material without relying to heavily on others. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do the readings - they help you understand the material 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Do your own work and do it well - that will get you far 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Don't be discouraged by the rigor of the problem sets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Don't be intimidated, and definitely take it with Keith. Although I didn't have much of a math or formal logic background coming into the class, I found that he introduced each concept thoroughly and in an digestible way. If you pay attention in lecture, do the problem sets, and go to office hours, you can understand the material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Don't be scared of this class! If you put the time in, you will be fine. Do the homeworks yourself before coming together as a group. You rarely lose points because your intuition on a problem was wrong. You lose points because you make a mistake in writing up your solution - this is where doing the problem yourself is critical. you can read through your group's answers and spot the little errors. Go to Keith's office hours - the queue to get help is less than for TAs and he is more helpful - the TAs are helpful, but not nearly as good as Keith. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Don't get discouraged, but also attempt to rigorously check your solutions with a partner and TAs. Look back at common mistakes. Class is very time intensive, so don't attempt with a heavy quarter unless you're willing to spend a large portion of your time on the course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Don't let the bad grades up front get you down. If you're getting good grades on things at the beginning, understand that it gets harder. Whatever student you are, always submit your next assignment with more effort than the one previous. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Don't take it unless you have to. It says its 5 units, feels like 15. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Expect to learn a lot of new material, but the focus of the class is more on learning standard proof formats that solving truly hard problems. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Extremely fun course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Fantastic course. Tough material but well taught. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Fascinating material, would highly recommend! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Get ready to work really hard, but it's going to feel very satisfying. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Go to lectures in person as much as you can and take notes with pencil and paper — it's both a great way to learn and a pleasure, as Keith is a very talented lecturer. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
good class 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Good class, a lot of work 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Good class, Keith is a great lecturer. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
good course, but make sure you have time in your schedule! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Good course. Probably more suited to non-math people, or people looking for a first introduction to theoretical math. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Good luck 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
great class! thank you, Keith! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Great class, would recommend, keith is the best. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Great course, really interesting, especially toward the end. Make sure to understand everything in lecture by the time the pset rolls around or it'll be hard to catch up. Work with a partner but don't depend on them, figure out the problems for yourself so you learn them 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Hard, time consuming -- don't take it with a crazy schedule. Start early on psets, go to office hours, and make sure you're using your time efficiently. With that out of the way, 103 is the by far best class I've taken at Stanford -- it's incredibly well organized, every pset question feels like it has a purpose and you really know why you're learning the material, not just plugging and chugging, and there are so many resources if you need help. Taking this class with Keith honestly changed my life -- he's so inspiring and uplifting and contagiously excited about the material and generally has a beautiful outlook on life. I've never had such a high return on my learning investment -- would absolutely recommend if you're interested in the intersection of CS, math, and philosophy. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Honestly, I took it because I had to and it's a TON of work, especially when you have a midterm and a pset in the same week. That being said, Keith is fantastic and I did learn a lot. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I am speechless. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I can't imagine taking this class seeing all the material for the first time. I had at least some degree of knowledge for almost everything that we covered, and many of the problem sets and exams were still mildly challenging, so it must be very hard to develop all the intuition necessary on the fly. I still think it would be really worth it, especially if you want to take any other math/theoretical CS course. There are definitely no other classes that teach you to write proofs as well as this. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I doubt anybody *regrets* taking this course (at least with Keith). His lecture style is legendary and you learn so much in that class. The PSets are nontrivial but there are plenty of resources 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I highly recommend this to programmers, mathematicians, philosophers, and anyone who is looking for something new, fascinating, and thought-provoking long after the course is over. Set aside ample time to do the problem sets and discuss problem sets and lectures with friends to get deeper understanding. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I kind of answered this in a previous question, but I'll say it again: even if you're having a really hard time in this class, I promise it's so worth it. I was in a pretty low percentile of the class for most of the quarter, but I've come away with such a love for the material. Also Keith is the most incredible human alive. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I really liked the course. Be prepared to work hard. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I recommend starting the problem sets early. Office hours are great resources not just to help you solve problems, but to verify that your approach is correct. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I would highly recommend taking this class, even if you have experience writing proofs and are familiar with the logic/set theory/functions. I say this because Keith has managed to promote a particular kind of learning that I have found to be very rare at Stanford, and I think learning from him gives this class a lot of value. I've taken a lot of classes that cover far more material, but none of them have made me work with as much focus as this one. For example, I didn't learn a ton of material about functions and relations, but I got to use that material in ways that really challenged me. I could not have learned in this particular way if more material had been covered in that time, which makes me really grateful to have taken this class and to have had Keith as an instructor. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
If you fall behind, it might be very tough to catch up. PSETs are sometimes very hard and time consuming, you will want to start them early to make sure you don't fall behind. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
If you gotta do it, do your best! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
If you have the option to take or not take this class (meaning you're not a CS Major) only take it if you are comfortable with the idea of writing a lot of proofs. It is a major part of the class and probably the worst part about it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
If you love solving problems, you can't afford to miss this course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
If you wanna learn things out of it, be prepared to put in 5 units of work. Otherwise, you might get through it fine, but it's not gonna be as much fun - you likely won't have time to digest the material and let it sufficiently blow your mind (which is for sure the coolest part of this course). If you're a math person who hasn't done proofwriting and wants to build up proofwriting skills, this is a great course for that (as long as you don't mind doing CS)! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
If you want a tour de force of theoretical math for computer scientists, this is your class. This class takes you places. If you engage with the class, you can go from knowing absolutely nothing about proof-based math (this was me) to not only being mathematically literate, but also understanding some really important aspects of the discipline of computer science. This is the class that separates a software engineer from a computer scientist. This sort of instruction is why a BS in CS does make you a better programmer. Take it. It will be hard, it will be frustrating, but it will definitely be rewarding. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It can often feel (especially at first) that this class is a test of how clever you are. It is absolutely not. Practice, practice, practice and you will improve on the intuition required to write proofs. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It is interesting but the problem sets are long 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It is not an easy course and plan accordingly 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It takes time 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It will radically alter your view of this world. Take it if you are prepared to start making changes in the way you understand this world. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
it's a fun class, but just because you understand all the material doesn't necessarily mean you will do well 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's a great class. It takes a whole lot of time, and you need to be prepared to put in that time to appreciate the material, but I think it's fascinating material and Keith is an amazing lecturer 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's a lot harder than it may seem! You will feel very disadvantaged if you have a hard time/not much experience with math, proof-writing, or theory. It's really interesting, but really, really challenging. It's not enough to just go to class and pay attention and look over notes. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's amazingly taught! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's an excellent course that is well-taught (Keith is amazing), engaging, and useful. Also, though the 106 courses are "pre-reqs," only a light familiarity with coding is required to achieve success in the class 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's fantastically taught. Be prepared to have your mind blown. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's fun you should do it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's fun! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's great. Just make time to practice and talk to TAs. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's hard without sections, so make sure to work in a group. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's really cool, especially if you care about math and computers. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It's very rewarding and interesting- I would def recommend this course, even if you are not studying Computer Science. However, make sure to get started on the problem sets early and seek help if you need it- It can be challenging! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Its alot of material, its hard in the beginning and gets easier over time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Just take it. It is incredibly, almost unbelievably well organized. Keith is a masterful lecturer who handles even the most challenging questions with grace. Him and the course staff are committed to seeing you succeed, and you will if you put in the effort. And you might pick up some life lessons along the way! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keep at it! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is a good and energetic lecturer and topics discussed, on retrospect seem pretty interesting. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is a great lecturer and the material is really cool 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is a great lecturer, very enthusiastic and teaches you a lot. The TAs were really not useful in helping you learn the material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is an amazing lecturer and the resources provided to you are incredibly helpful. Do the psets early, check with a partner, go to office hours, and you'll be fine. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is an AMAZING lecturer! Psets do take time, and it's fundamental to really understand the concepts, however. However, the stuff covered in the class is super interesting, and Keith honestly makes everything so bearable.
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is an amazing lecturer. Grading is quite harsh. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is awesome! Get excited for Godel's incompleteness theory and the downfall of the thought process that you can prove every truth. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith is so great! If people say this class is really hard... don't listen to them and find out for yourself! If you approach the concepts in the right way the pace will be ok. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith lives up to the hype. Great professor 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Keith Schwarz gives great instruction and an overall good introductory instruction into mathematical logic. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Make sure to keep up with the lectures. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Make sure you check your work when you are doing the problem sets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Make sure you have the time to put into this course. If you can dedicate yourself and put the time aside, you will learn a lot. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Mind the time commitment. Go to/watch lecture. Do those things and the course is really interesting and very manageable. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Pay close attention to your feedback on the first couple problem sets; and use Keith's office hours 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Pretty challenging; try to get literally every proof checked by a TA(make them nitpick) really delve into every topic 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
pset will take your whole time 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Really interesting! But challenging. By far the hardest class I've taken at Stanford, and I did the worst in this class by far. Be prepared to dedicate time to it, or take it Cr/Nc. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Really look at your phrasing, because what you say isn't always what you mean. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Seek out help in figuring out how to write and structure proofs at the very beginning of the class, and do so actively! Also don't be like me and spend hours staring at a problem without any progress; past a certain point its not helping you learn at all. Give it your best shot, and if you can't get it, seek help from TAs or peers or however best works for you. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Seriously put in time to make the psets nice 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
skip to 154 for not discrete-math-for-cs-majors and the rest of sipser. if you're new to math and theoretical cs, though, this is certainly a very well-taught introduction. psets are pretty interesting. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Space out your work, clarify concepts with TAs, and you'll do great. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
start problem sets early 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Start the homeworks early and have a homework buddy. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Start working on the problems sets from day 1. It is a challenging class and it will require a great investment of time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Stay on top of the material and be sure to ask for help if you don't fully understand something; a lot of the material builds on itself! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Study and discuss problems with other people who are taking CS103 or already took CS103. Some concepts are easy to misinterpret. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Study the small unimportant details as that will seem to be all you get tested on, for no reason 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it and take it early. This course will start to change how you think about and approach programming in general and is a great experience. Don't be intimidated if you're not comfortable with theoretical math or writing proofs, but do be ready to put in the time it takes to learn the skill. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it but be ready to work. Keith is amazing but you can't learn everything from lecture. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
take it if you can put in the work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
take it with a light quarter 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it with enough time in your schedule. Don't get down if you don't do as well as you like on the tests, they are crapshoots. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it with Keith! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it with Keith! Great lecturer, fascinating material :) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it with Keith! He is a fantastic lecturer and really makes you believe in yourself. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it with Keith! This class is very challenging (make sure to leave plenty of time in your schedule), but Keith brings the excitement and understanding you need to make it fun. Also, take 103A with it (super helpful TA's there and great practice problems), and go to OH (have them check your proofs). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it with Keith!!!!! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it with people you know 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
take it! definitely an extremely fun and rewarding class 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it! It'll be a lot of fun! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it! Keith is an incredible instructor. He's dynamic, funny, and so so interesting. It's rare to find an instructor who so greatly enjoys the material he's teaching, and even more difficult to find one willing to go beyond expectations to teach the material and make sure we're all 1) on the same page and 2) happy, healthy and well advised on life as Stanford students (as well as address some deep, philosophical yet mathematically relevant questions). This is by far the best class I've taken at Stanford. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
take it! the material is interesting and fun! It feels like you're solving puzzles, not doing psets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it! Whether it's required for your major or not. It's a very fun interesting class. You need to put some amount of work for it (shouldn't be more than 10-15 hours a week) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it, and be ready to work hard. You may not get it the first time, but it's honestly a great class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it, but it's very hard. I I struggled a lot but I found it a worthwhile experience. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it, it will definitely change the way you think about how hard and impossible math is 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
take it, you'll learn a whole lot about math and about computing 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it. Best class I've had at Stanford. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it. Great Course. Learned a lot 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
TAKE IT. My favorite class I've taken at Stanford. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it; you will learn so much 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take the class. It is a great introduction to theoretical math and proof writing. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
TAKE THIS CLASS FRESHMAN YEAR. Before you take Math 51 or Math 60 or whatever they've done with Freshman math. Take this class first. They try and introduce logic and proofs with linear algebra but it's just a dumb idea. Doing it in the context of Computer Science is so much better. Trust me. Take this class now. Don't do what I did and take it Senior year. The benefits of CS 103 will keep coming back to bless you for all of your other math and CS classes later on. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take this course if you are interested in studying cool ideas and interesting results in theoretical computer science. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take this course if you have to for the major or because you need to write proofs in the future. Otherwise, this class is challenging so not something you would take lightly. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
TAKE. LEARN. LOVE. Keith is the absolute greatest, and you would be doing yourself a disservice to leave him out of your Stanford education. This class literally teaches you how to think and reason effectively, and you can immediately apply some of the concepts (e.g. Pigeonhole Principle) to real life outside the context of class. How cool is that?! No matter your interests or your major, take the class and be enlightened! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Thanks! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
The class is really fun, and the teachers are really helpful! But, the class expects a lot out of you, and there will be a lot of work! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
The content is abstract and not easy to pick up, but it is critical to understand computing. Keith does a great job of keeping things interesting.
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
The material is cool and worth learning 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
The pace is way too fast. Take it with no other hard courses. Do the problem sets only on your own, that way you understand what is going on. Otherwise you will fall behind and not understand what is going on. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
The PSETs and examinations are very difficult, especially in the beginning. But if you put in the time and effort in the PSETs and the lectures, you will learn a lot from this class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
The skills you get from CS103 may not directly help you with programming, but the precise thinking that is required in the course will result in you becoming better in reasoning and arguing in any setting -- skills that are transferable to any discipline. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
There's a lot of information to cover 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This class is a huge time commitment so plan your quarter with that in mind. Start the PSets early and get help! Also, it continuously gets harder throughout the quarter so stay on top of the material. Good luck! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This class is very theory heavy and a lot of proof writing. If you are new to mathematical theory and proof writing, be prepared to spend a lot of extra time on this class. This class also moves very quickly and is very time consuming. Just keep this in mind when deciding your work load for the quarter. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This class made me fall in love with math again. It's incredibly well-taught (the lectures are always fantastic and fun), and problem sets are challenging and rewarding. Take this class! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This course is definitely do-able, but you can't expect to understand the material without fully participating in doing the problem sets. Keith is an excellent lecturer so go to lecture and ask questions when you don't understand something. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This course is fascinating and the instructor is on top of his game and a truly remarkable lecturer and teacher. Whether a CS major or not, if you are interesting in the theoretical bounds of computer science this course is highly recommended. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is a great course, but it is really tough and a big challenge. If you're interested by it, you should definitely take it. Just make sure to put in the time and respect the class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is a survey course and does not go into considerable depth with regards to any of the topics. You will be expected to write proofs according to a strict set of semantics. TAs and Keith are hesitant if not completely resistant to answering questions directly and will send you in dizzying circles until you just give up on asking them questions and succumb to their writing style just to get through the class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is a truly fascinating course that will make you a better thinker and a better computer scientist. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is a very challenging course. I think what's important in this class is figuring out how to work efficiently and effectively to understand concepts given a limited amount of time. I would also say that this shouldn't be the class that determines whether or not one wants to do CS in college and in the future. If you are struggling, don't be disheartened if you find yourself lost in the class and are barely getting by with P-sets and exams (this was me basically the last one-third of the class). Years into the future, how well you do in this particular class won't be a huge factor in determining your success. What is important is your ability to remain resilient, maintain an optimistic perspective, and persevere through struggle and failure. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is a wonderful class to take. It will challenge you, but it will be very rewarding. Guaranteed. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is an amazing course. Your skills in terms of reasoning through CS theory will improve dramatically through lots of interesting lectures and problem sets. On the flip side, in order to have this improvement, you do need to expend significant effort (and time) towards the course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is an excellently taught class that is a very solid introduction to proof writing as well as cs theory. Keith is awesome. Would definitely recommend, even if you do not plan to study cs. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is by far the best taught class I have taken at Stanford. Keith pours his heart and soul into making you love the material, so if you have any interest at all in the material, go for it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is hands down one of the most interesting and engaging (and healthily challenging) classes I've ever taken. Keith makes this class incredible and getting to know him and learn from him was one of the greatest gifts i've gotten at stanford so far so tldr: this class is good 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is not an easy class, especially if you have never taken any type of theoretical, formal math before. However, you will learn so much (it's kind of crazy), and the content really is fascinating. Not to mention Keith is a fantastic professor! Surround yourself with friends who are also in the class and push through! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This was a great class with a fantastic, enthusiastic, intelligent instructor. It's not easy and you will learn a lot, but it is enjoyable and rewarding. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This was a very challenging but rewarding class. Starting early on the problem sets and really trying to get the best score possible really pushed me to understand the concepts. The class was a major time sink, but it was definitely worth it. Definitely take it if you're considering CS, Keith is an amazing instructor. Despite not having any background in writing proofs or in discrete math, I found the course very accessible and I feel like I've learned an immense amount about how to solve problems and how to reason about problems in computer science. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This was the most interesting course I've ever taken, to be honest. -Benjamin Williams 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
try to learn beyond just whats taught 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Understand that it is a time intensive class - it might not be wise to take it with other demanding classes 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Utilize office hours as much as you can, the TA's and Keith really want you to understand the material and try in a million different ways to accomplish this goal. The class is extremely organized and well-setup, so take advantage of this and use the resources available to you. Partner up, make sure members are contributing equally, and have conversations with them if that's not the case. Make sure you've given each problem an honest effort before attempting them as a group. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Very hard, but so interesting and worth it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Very rewarding, but be prepared for some dark moments of confusion. Ok that's a bit hyperbolic, But it's an awesome love/hate thing with these PSets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Watch/go to every lecture and start the problem sets early 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
work hard 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Working on the PSETs can feel like trying to grasp quicksand sometimes, but finally coming up an elegant, concise proof is a badass feeling. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Wow, I wish I had had someone like Keith teaching me in my undergrad. Very clear and interesting teaching, very energetic, keeps the material connected to the bigger picture, and very supportive and helpful with advice. This is a great class to get started in CS. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
You are in for something special. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
You learn so much so fast in this course. It really flys by, but it is a lot of fun and Keith is an amazing lecturer. Definitely recommend it, even if you aren't a CS person. Workload is somewhat heavy, but I had no problem taking it and CS110 at the same time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
You will gain an intuitive understanding of computation, and see a glimpse of current problems/leading research in computability and complexity theory. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
You will learn an insane amount in a short amount of time, it is very rewarding. Be prepared to work hard because the material is challenging. If you are choosing between this and another class, you should absolutely take it. Find a good pset group 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
you'll have to do a lot of independent learning - lectures are like getting hit with a firehose; grading is harsh- makes doing homework scary and dangerous, you can become depressed, lots of students are constantly stressed out unnecessarily; all my friends say class can lower your self esteem 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
You're probably taking this class because it's a requirement for CS or some other major you're interested in. It's definitely a challenging course, but also very interesting. A lot of people, including myself, said that they really enjoy the material but have a hard time separating their fascination with the material and the demoralizing pset grades they're receiving. Just know that if you work hard to learn everything, the class will turn out alright, and it definitely is a very cool class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Don't take it over the summer. I've heard only good things about the teacher who teaches this course during the academic year, Keith Schwartz. The summer version was very rushed and often really disorganized, and it was frustrating to feel like the material wasn't getting laid out in the way it would have been during the year. The summer instructor was a nice guy but he often seemed pretty under-prepared and wasn't super great at explaining the material to people who weren't already familiar with it. 
(with McKay, Dylan M, 2015/2016, Summer)
take it with Keith Schwarz 
(with McKay, Dylan M, 2015/2016, Summer)
wait for keith 
(with McKay, Dylan M, 2015/2016, Summer)
Absolutely take it! Makes you a better thinker. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Absolutely take it. Extremely interesting and an incredible introduction to proofs and theoretical computer science, although it's a really really hard class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Absolutely take it. Forget about grades for a bit and just look at what you're learning and dealing with. Be amazed and overwhelmed for a bit. This class will challenge you more than most but it's oddly centering. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Absolutely take this class, even if you would have never thought that you had an interest in theoretical computer science. This class really pushes you, especially if you've had no prior experience writing proofs, but it's super rewarding and deeply thought provoking. Be sure to stay motivated/positive, and don't get discouraged by the exams (they are a little outlandish). If you focus and work hard on the problem sets and lectures, you will be amazed how much you learn in ten weeks. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)

ask questions, a lot of questions, to get better intuition. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Be precise; Give plenty of hours to doing the psets 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Be prepared for a heavily theoretical math course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Be prepared for a lot of work! This course squeezes a year's worth of topics into one quarter. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Be prepared to absorb a lot of material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Be prepared to have your mind blown

Course is well taught and well organized. To be successful you need to keep up with the work and use resources. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
CS 103 is probably my favorite course of my undergraduate career so far. Keith is a fantastic lecturer, and the material he teaches is incredibly interesting. I would highly recommend it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
CS103 is a great course! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
CS103 is really interesting and you learn a lot, but it's super hard and a huge time commitment. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
CS103 will most likely be unfamiliar territory for you, but it is so worth it. Make sure that you have time to put hard work and effort into problem sets and studying for midterms/finals. Also, show up to lecture. I know the videos are online, but Keith is a FANTASTIC lecturer and you will be more engaged/develop a greater understanding if you take the class in this way. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Definitely a great introduction to formal mathematics. Would recommend over any of the introductory proof-based math classes in the 100s (I took one last quarter and didn't really get as good a handle of proofs as I did in this class). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Definitely recommend this course, course is very well taught and content is very new and interesting 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Definitely recommend. Make sure you stay on top of everything and ask question or it can get confusing fast. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Definitely take it, but make sure you are understand how much time the weekly assignments will take. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
definitely take this class!!!! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
difficult class but you learn a lot 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
DO IT this course is super super interesting 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do it! CS Theory is super interesting in my opinion, and Keith does a great job of making the material approachable 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do it! Especially if Keith is teaching. Perhaps the most well run course i've ever taken. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do not get intimidated, the course starts off fast but you will get it with time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do not take this class with a hard quarter. Also, if you find yourself struggling on exams, do not get discouraged. Writing proofs with time pressure is difficult and is a learned skill 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Do the PSETS by yourself even if you have a group 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't be intimidated by the course, and how confident in your own abilities. I think at times I let my own personal issues affect my performance in the class, whether or not I asked questions, and whether or not I went to office hours. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't be like me, start the pset early and go to office hours 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't do it alone. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't let yourself fall behind with lectures 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't take 19 units while taking this course, it almost killed me 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Don't take it if possible 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Even if you're not a CS major, definitely take this class! You'll gain a new and more nuanced perspective on what formal reasoning actually is and you'll gain a better understanding of what computing actually is, as well as what it can and can't do. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Excellent class. Super interesting. Also very hard though, and the proportion of students that do well in the class is surprisingly high, meaning that the curve sucks 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Fantastic course! Lots of interesting material and Keith is a great lecturer who makes concepts very clear. Material can be overwhelming and so can the amount of work but very rewarding in the end. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)

Good job on deciding to take 103! It's a really fun course taught by a great instructor, but be prepared for a good challenge. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Great Class! really interesting! It is a fair amount of work and gets tough but leaves you with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Great course to learn about computer science theory. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Great course! Keith is a really engaging and humorous lecturer. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Great course, don't get behind. The material is very interesting, but not if you are waiting until the last day to do the psets, when you just wanna be done with homework. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
I absolutely recommend this class to everyone, it was a great experience and I learned an incredible amount of stuff, and this was all from starting from a base of having no experience in this subject area 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
I dislike this course. Grading is extremely difficult on tests and you absolutely need partners for psets. But you will learn a lot. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
I was frustrated out of my mind about my grade in this class. Several times I felt points were taken off for very arbitrary or subjective reasons.However, I felt my grades almost never accurately portrayed my knowledge of the material, so I can certainly say this is the class I have learned the most from at my time here so far. You will learn an unbelievable amount of incredibly interesting information from this class, but it may be an infuriating process. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would highly recommend this course to anyone vaguely interested in math, computer science, or problem solving in general. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
I would recommend anyone with an interest in learning more about CS theory to take this class. Coming in with some prior background in maths helps, but strictly speaking is not needed. The problem sets do an excellent job of reinforcing concepts presented in class. If you can, try to take this class alongside CS 106B; they complement each other very well, especially with graph theory and computability and complexity theory. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
If you don't have any mathematical experience in proof-writing, it's not a problem at all! The class is designed to be an incredibly sound foundation as an intro to proofs and the use of math in CS. (If you do, you'll probably coast through the material, but you may find, like me, that it still requires a considerable amount of effort and that your prior experience, while greatly helpful, won't give you the answers every time.) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
If you put in the effort to understand the material and you plug away at the psets ON YOUR OWN you will be amazed by the incredible results you prove in this class. Don't be worried if you have had negative experiences with math in high school, Keith introduces a completely different type of math (proof-based math) and since we build up everything from the ground up, it's almost as if you are given another chance to do well in math. Expect to be dazzled and enjoy! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
If you're not sure about doing CS after taking 106A, definitely take this class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
If you're taking it on SCPD like me, try to start your PSETs earlier so you can actually make it to office hours. ALSO try not to stress too much on the tests. The exams are actually pretty straightforward and only test for the knowledge you were taught, so the biggest way to mess them up is to panic and/or not get enough sleep (as I did on the first exam). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Incredible course. A must-take in my opinion. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It gets better! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is a great course. Make sure you put in enough time and effort to learn everything. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is a great way to practice or start thinking logically and doing proofs about interesting topics. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is a lot of work but can be very rewarding. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is a rigorous course but definitely doable, especially with the resources provided. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is a very interesting course, it gets harder towards the end but it is still worth taking 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It is not an easy course, but it is by no means impossible to do. I think you learn a good deal from this class, but it will require a lot of work and a desire to learn the topics. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
it moves very quickly and covers a lot of material. also, don't let your grades discourage you (but i'd say this about any class) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It moves very quickly and you need to read the notes and keep up with lectures. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
it takes more time than you expect, but it's super interesting 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's a good course! Go enjoy Keith's class 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's a hard class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's a lot of time 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's a lot of work during the quarter, the final is really hard 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's a serious workload and graded intensely -- sometimes, it seems, just out of spite! -- so proceed with caution. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's a theory class. So it's kinda boring.. to me at least, cuz it's not like writing program where at least you're building something that's somehow useful. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's about the journey, not the destination

It's amazing tKe it and believe in yor self and love it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
IT'S DOPE!!! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's extremely difficult, so utilize your resources (office hours, CS103A, the course reader). Also, be in a good group. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's hard but worth it. Even if you're not a CS major, take it (but maybe s/nc). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's hard! Only take it if you are pretty invested in the course material, otherwise it will be extremely difficult to catch on. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's very difficult and the psets take forever, but it's worth it if you're interested in the subject. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
It's very difficult, but you learn so much interesting material. It's totally worth it! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Its a good class, though it is difficult if you fall behind and don't understand things. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Its hard 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Its very hard 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Just take it! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Keith is a fantastic teacher. Don't get behind. Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you can't understand something at first, don't despair, just wrestle with it and give it time, you'll get it eventually! If you give this class the time it deserves, it won't disappoint. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Keith is an amazing instructor. Make use of him while you can! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Keith is an amazing teacher -- although the material is difficult, you will learn so much! Also, you should take 103A. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Like before, this class is challenging but the fun kind. Keith makes everything about this class so great! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
lots of work but worth it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure Keith is teaching it cause he is awesome. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure that you have enough free time available to keep up with the material. It was not uncommon to spend 15-20 hours just on the weekly problem set, and that is on top of readings/lectures/studying and even just keeping up with administrative things (monitoring the message boards, printing out and reading handouts, etc.). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure you at least understand the intuition behind proofs because sometimes they are very pretty. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure you know how to write proofs exactly the way the professor wants to see them. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Make sure you know the material, ask questions if you don't, don't procrastinate (too much). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Most interesting class I've taken at stanford and Keith is an amazing teacher! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
One of the hardest classes I've taken at Stanford, but also one of my favorites, simply because of how much it pushed me intellectually and how much I feel like I learned in just 10 weeks. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
One of the most interesting courses I have taken at Stanford so far 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
only if your major requires it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Only take it if you have to 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Phenomenal Class!! I recommend checking over answers with a group but submitting psets individually and doing all the problems yourself. This will take more time than splitting up work with others, but will help you so much more in understanding the material and grasping the concepts, which particularly in the last few weeks of the course on computability and complexity theory can be hard to understand. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Please take this seriously. I wish I had cared more at the beginning of the quarter. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Prepare yourself 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Really great course. Incredibly interesting subject, and Keith does a fantastic job with it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Really really catch up on lectures 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
start early 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Start proofs early! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Start the problem sets early 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Start the problem sets early. They are fun when you have enough time, but a nightmare if you don't. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Start those problem sets early 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Stay on top of lectures, do all the problems on the problem sets (i.e., don't go 50/50 with a partner), and start the problem sets a couple of days before they are due because sometimes you come up with proofs in your sleep. Also this course is great and the material is very interesting, so you should definitely take it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Stay on top of lectures. Don't try to watch a week's worth in one sitting. Also, don't multi-task while watching lectures (even mindless tasks like folding laundry), Keith covers a lot of material, very quickly. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Study a lot, attend office hours, and if you start off slow with bad midterm grades, it's ok because you'll learn how to learn from your mistakes 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Suffer into truth! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take advantage of all the resources offered because there are so many; as long as you do, you are almost guaranteed to understand the material. The weeks I went to office hours were so much more clear than the weeks I didn't. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take any class Keith teaches -- he's fantastic 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take CS103. Seriously. It was a great experience for me because it helped me gain confidence in my ability to solve proof-based problems. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
TAKE IT 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it for Keith. He will uplift and inspire you and make you feel like life has meaning and people in this world care about important things and that there are things worth fighting for. Seriously, I have a list of Keith quotes that I pull out for inspiration every once in a while. He just cares so much about inclusivity and diversity in CS (and the tech industry in general) and is also a wonderful human being with a beautiful outlook on life. Or if you like doing proofs for fun and thinking about things that make your brain hurt. If you're that person, snaps for you, but you're kinda crazy. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it it's awesome 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it seriously and stay on top of your work! Other than that it's a great class, Keith is awesome. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT WITH KEITH BEST CLASS EVER. 100/10 would recommend. Makes up for all my other poorly taught math/cs classes 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it with friends who you know are reliable. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
take it with keith 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it with Keith, he explains it best and puts some of the people in the Math department to shame with teaching ability. Start the problem sets early. DO NOT GET BEHIND ON LECTURES or it will bite you back 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it with Keith. He is an amazing instructor and one of the best teachers I have ever had. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it with Keith. He is an excellent lecturer, and pairs the homeworks very well with the content of the course that he's covering. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it with Keith. It's incredibly well taught and Keith is extremely passionate about the subject. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it with little units, or else be prepared to take it again, friend. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it with pset partners you like, you'll spend a lot of time with them 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it! Amazing course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it! It's a difficult class, but you learn a lot in the process. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it! It's amazingly taught and really interesting! You should just be able to put enough time for it because it's time consuming 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it! Keith is a fantastic professor, the kind you will only get once in a while. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
take it! keith is one of the best teachers I've ever had and you can really tell he cares a lot about the subject and the students. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
take it! you'll learn a fundamentally different way of thinking about problems. It's not as hard as it sounds - although it is a decent amount of time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it!! And read solution sets. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it!! It is a class that will make you look at the world differently and with new perspectives! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
take it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it. Invest time into it. Prove everything from scratch to really get it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take it; be prepared to give it a lot of your time to solidify understanding, but if the topic sounds at least mildly interesting, you'll likely enjoy the course 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take some easy classes on the side, because you'll need plenty of practice to master this material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take the course. You'll come out of it understanding why some people enjoy math so much. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take this class! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Take this with Keith! He's amazing. The class is amazing. You'll be working a lot -- and learning a lot. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
The amount of time you spend studying does not necessarily pay off for this class. Do not sacrifice going to class in order to get more time to study for the midterms. You will get behind, the midterm grade may not reflect your expectations, and you'll have to play catch-up for the rest of the quarter, which will be utterly miserable. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
The concepts don't come to some people as easily as others, but don't be discouraged. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
The course is really interesting in that you learn a lot about theory and logic, something that is usually not touched upon in other courses, but the course is definitely harder than I anticipated. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
The final is hard. Be prepared. Know all the latter material well since everything will be jam packed and you will have other classes to study for. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
The lectures are long and can be difficult to stay on top of after 50 minutes & the break. Bring chocolate to class to stay alert 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
The problem sets can get tedious at times, but lectures are enjoyable. It will also tighten up you're thinking and writing skills. And at the end everything will come together. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
There is no teacher more dedicated to helping you succeed than Keith 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This class is amazing! It's a lot of content but it's taught well, and the class is made for you to succeed in it. If you care about these topics, definitely take it. One of my favorite classes at Stanford so far. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This class is time consuming, it should be in your top one priority if you want to do well, unless you are a genius 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This class is very poorly advertised: don't take this class for an introduction to CS theory. This class is primarily an introduction to proofs for students who are not very mathematically inclined: it moves slowly, and allows people who might otherwise feel lost in the math to gain abilities and confidence. However, if you're more mathematically inclined and want to learn how to write rigorous proofs, take a 100 level math class. If you have proof experience and want to take a CS theory course, take 154. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course has a heavy workload. If you are an SCPD student plan your work schedule accordingly. Also the on-campus students have several advantages that SCPD students don't have (CS103A, much more OH access, quicker access to solutions, and just general collaboration from being on-campus) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course is amazing! Keith is a great lecturer and is really passionate about the material. The material is super interesting, and lectures and homework are very well organized 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course is both interesting and challenging, I highly recommend this course! I'm a SCPD student and this is the best course I've ever taken among the few courses I've already tried. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course is difficult and will test you, there's no question about it. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with the material - it really is a 5-unit class - but if you are prepared to put in the time and effort, you will get so much out of it! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course is super challenging, but in the end I really enjoyed learning all the concepts. You learn a lot about how to think critically about problems, and different ways to prove something rigorously. The parts of this class I found most interesting was studying the limits of computation. I feel like this class has trained the way I think about problems. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This course is time intensive, so be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This has been my second favorite course so far. It's exciting material, well taught, manageable, and well worth it in general. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is a great course with a very engaging and welcomming professor! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is a must have course to help you in your career in CS. It will help you organize your brain so developing new solutions is easier. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is a very fun and excellent course for all students interested in either math or cs. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is a WONDERFUL course, and it's a lot of fun. Put time into the Psets- really make sure you are understanding how to do every question. Ask questions in class and after class, and don't stress. You'll be fine :) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is an extremely good class to take and do not be afraid to struggle with the proofs. Start them early and take breaks. Also, do not get too stuck in any one line of reasoning try random things. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is by far the best course I've taken in my life. Never before CS103 had I taken a course that had such a profound impact on my interests as this class. The instruction is top-notch, and I really felt like Keith and the staff really cared about my learning, which is a rare thing. Being in this class was a privilege. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is one of the most interesting classes, but with that comes great responsibility. You HAVE to talk to TAs to make sure you know EXACTLY whats going on and how to formalize your intuitions, otherwise you can think you know the material very well, but it won't translate to your exams. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This is the best class I've ever taken! Take it for sure, it made me rethink my major 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
This might be the best taught class I've taken so far at Stanford. It takes a lot of energy to stay caught up, but the material is interesting and it makes it worth the time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Totally worth it 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Truly engage with the material, allow yourself to explore the implications. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Understand all the problems sets. Reading through Keith's slides is a great review for the exams. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Unless you can't live without math the main reason you would take this it's a requirement for the cs major. Also you probably wanna take it with keith 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Warm up for the exams by doing a practice problem before each exam. It gets you in the right mindset. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Work hard and it'll pay off, no matter how overwhelming the course material may seem. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Work hard! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Work together with other students to solve the problems. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
Work with other people on the problem sets or you will die a horrible death 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
You will learn so much. By the end of it, you will be amazed at all that you have learned. We can't solve all problems, and you'll see why. Your mind will be blown. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Winter)
-- Superb class, which takes difficult math concepts and makes them very digestible -- It is impressive how much you learn and understand after this class. I achieved a theoretical math fluency that I never thought was possible -- Make sure to invest the time to learn each week's set of materials, the material builds quite quickly and it would be hard to catch up 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
A lot of this course is based on your knowledge and ability to think critically and come up with ways to manipulate definitions or use definitions to prove something. This requires a firm understanding of the definitions in a way that you know what each definition defines and what it doesn't. Make sure to check edge cases for everything, possibilities for a potential conflict, and if something does not feel right or you can't seem to prove it in a clean way, it may indicate something wrong with your interpretation of the definition. I would recommending reading Keith's handouts. To fit the information in a 1.5 hour lecture is impressive, but to fully obtain a comprehensive knowledge of what is going on, read and study the handouts. Even handouts on Mathematical Vocabulary Negations or Proofs are extraordinarily helpful in clarifying issues that people without previous mathematical background or proof background have. Of course you should also do the Problem sets. Beyond being educational and because you should do them to actually learn the material, they have very interesting problems. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Absolutely take it. Just make sure you go to lecture and really pay attention to detail, it's important in proof based mathematics. Also, don't freak out if you can't get it at first. It really takes time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Amazing online resources, energetic lectures, and huge classes. CS 103 may be described as brutal by some, but it really is a mind-blowing class that all CS majors hate to admit they love. Keith kills it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Attend lectures as they are quite informative and try to do the problem sets by yourself before you discuss the answers with your group. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Awesome class, work hard on the psets, go to lecture, think critically about material. Talk to Keith, he's brilliant! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Be aware: CS103 is an "intro" class, but there is a ton of material in this class that you'll constantly be climbing up hill trying to understand. Make sure you have the time to put in for this class. It's worth it. Also if you're a bad tester, watch out. The tests can be a little rough ( not a lot of leeway). 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Be prepared to put in a lot of work. Go to office hours! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Be prepared to work hard--the concepts you learn are extremely challenging to wrap your mind around at first. However, this is also one of the most rewarding and impactful courses I've ever taken, and I would highly recommend it to anyone even if they aren't thinking about being a computer science major. I feel like I've emerged from the class as a better problem-solver and abstract thinker. I definitely don't think I see the world the same way after this class. Also, if you can, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take this class with Keith Schwarz--he singlehandedly made the class as fantastic as it is. If I didn't already know the material, I'd definitely take it again. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Beware of the tests. He makes them much harder than the examples in lectures 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Can be tough (depending on your background) but very worth it (Keith is awesome!) 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
concepts are difficult, go to office hours, spend time digesting the material, definitely a class you need to work hard in 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Cool stuff, Keith is enjoyable to listen to 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
CS 103: Do all of the Psets on your own! I think this is crucial and if you do decide to work in a group only use them as a way to check over your answers. CS 103A: Try to work through as much questions as you can while your there because you probably won't have time to do it after 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
CS103 is definitely a challenging class; make sure that you're willing to put the time into doing the problem sets and really thoroughly learning the material (and topics are covered quite quickly in lecture, so be sure to also keep up with lecture!). Keith is a really engaging instructor and does a great job of making the topics that we learn exciting and applicable. Overall, a great class though, I learned a ton. I found the material toward the end to be more challenging (languages, automata, complexity theory) but also super, super interesting! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
CS103 will amaze you but will come with a good deal of hard work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
def start early on stuff 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Definitely take it! And take it with Keith! The first part of the course might seem a little boring and just like math, but the second part is where it gets really interesting, and it will change how you see computer science! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Definitely take this class with Keith! The subject matter is very engaging, interesting, and lends a lot of insight into many other fields of study. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Do all the problem sets early 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Do not-- I repeat--do not take this class concurrently with CS 107. This class, while very interesting, is rigorous and requires a tremendous amount of time if you have never seen the material before. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Do the practice problem sets - they make the exams a lot easier 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
do the psets on your own before consulting with your group 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Do the psets on your own! PLEASE do not do it in groups. It is a bad idea. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
DO THE WORK!!!!!!!!!! The only way to learn this material is: 1) go to lectures, 2) do the problem sets (not your partner doing them), 3) go to office hours, 4) ASK FOR HELP There are no shortcuts in life. There are also no shortcuts in CS103. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Do TONS of practice problems 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Don't be worry if you think problemsets are hard; exams are much easier.. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Don't take it with a heavy quarter if you have never done proof mathematics before 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Don't worry about your grade. This class is made to teach you a lot, really fast. Try to really dig your heels in to grind for the educative ride of your life. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Don't! Or if you must, learn the material beforehand. The material at the end is incredibly difficult and mostly doesn't build on itself, so it's hard to gain experience and improve. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Expect to be challenged. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Find a study group to complete the problem sets. They are impossible to do alone. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
get them to record the class 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
go to office hours, start your psets asap, and study hard for exams. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Go to office hours, they're super helpful. Don't slack of for a single second 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Good class, but expect to spend a lot of time on it! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Great class regardless of your major beacuse of the problem solving skills it teaches and because keith really does a fantastic job 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Great class! Incredibly interesting and cool material that I feel I learned well. Keith is a fantastic lecturer and we had good TAs as well. You'll want to do every problem set question at some point during the quarter, but if you need to let your group do a few without you on a given week, it's okay to leave some problems as exam preparation. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Great class! Take it with Keith. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Great course, definitely learned a lot. Very constant workload but very interesting material. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)

Have fun! Relax!

Having good teammates to work with for the psets will make the class a much more enjoyable experience for you. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Highly recommend either going to lecture or taking it when they record it. I was unable to attend and missed out on some very interesting lectures.

Honestly, this was one of, if not the best courses I've taken at Stanford. The material is extremely interesting, and even when it's not, Keith finds a way to make it engaging. Find a solid group for PSets. They can definitely be done in a night, but make sure to go over them at the beginning of the week and sketch out your approach so that you can go to office hours if you're really stumped.

I hated proof and never thought I would enjoy theory area, but I found myself enjoy learning material in this course. It was a lot of work and sometimes felt very frustrated for not being able to handle any psets unless I spent hours in office hours, but I say it worth all the stresses.

I think there's far too much material covered in too short of a time. I felt underwater most of the quarter, and the TAs were usually swapped with too many people to provide any reasonable amount of help without a significant amount of wait time. A big part of the learning came from interaction with TAs, but there were simply too many people in this class to make it a smooth interaction. I'd tell students to study hard, keep up with the material, but to make sure you have other sources of support rather than the ones directly from the class.

I wish I had gone to more office hours. Don't underestimate the difficulty of tests. Start psets early. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
I would highly recommend it. This was my favorite class I have taken at Stanford, by far. I don't really think of myself as a computer science person, and I wouldn't have thought that "math of computer science" would be fascinating, but I loved this course. I think a huge part of this was that Keith's teaching was amazing, and all the problem sets were very carefully thought out. I certainly didn't find this course easy, but I also didn't find it too difficult, largely because the material was so interesting. By the end, I didn't even care what grade I got because I had learned so much. It also basically helped me to decide what to major in, and built my confidence greatly in my mathematical abilities, as I am now planning to major in MCS.

I'd tell them to take it and that it is true to its 5 units

If you're like me, you've never seen a wink of anything listed on the syllabus and the only experience of "proofs" you've had in the past was in geometry class (if you can even count that). Be strong, my friends. This will be an adventure. The following three things are what I've personally learned are important in not only in this class, but all others I'll take in the future: 1) If you don't understand something, ask your friends and/or course staff to clarify it as soon as you possibly can. Don't think that some problem you didn't understand from a certain set will be the last you'll ever see it. A concept you don't understand is like mold––the longer you let it sit and ignore it, the more it'll infect your understanding of future concepts that build off of it. Don't sacrifice your own intellectual clarity for fear of sounding dumb when you ask your question. Chances are that there's someone else who's feeling the same way. Have courage, dear heart (for yourself and for the greater good)! 2) Learn by doing, not by reviewing. This means practicing hard concepts through doing and redoing problems will better help you than infinitely scrolling through Keith's online lecture slides. This is a class testing skill, not memory! 3) Don't give up. There's a chance you might feel like a small fish in a big pond of other students who seem they have bigger fishbrains based on their midterm scores. I certainly felt like a small fish. Malcolm Gladwell wrote an essay (https://goo.gl/WkO3c7) discussing how prestigious colleges like Stanford naturally form an environment where students feel "relatively deprived" of their own intelligence. He argues that it's better to be a big fish in a small pond, essentially because smart students quit faster when they feel like a small fish in a big pond. My advice to you is: don't quit. You, my friend, are intelligent. "Caroline" in Gladwell's essay couldn't find the support she needed when she was struggling in her chemistry class. Luckily, there is abundant support in CS103 (and arguably, in Stanford in general). Go to office hours, ask questions on Piazza, enroll in CS103A. Do everything it takes for you to learn all that is taught. But whatever you do, do not quit.

Interesting concepts, psets are long. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Interesting course; there's some material that is quite good, but you'll probably find yourself a bit frustrated at the beginning esp. with the grading.
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It is a good class that you will learn a lot from if you put in the effort. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
it is a great course but you can fall behind easily especially in the second half if you don't keep up with your work 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It is a very hard course. The materials in it are super interesting, much of it philosophical. You will learn a great deal, but it will require a ton of hard work. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It IS AN AWESOME COURSE. TAKE IT WITH KETIH 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It is certainly an interesting class. It is still hard for me to understand how the first and second halves of the class are that related, but both are interesting nonetheless 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It is much more helpful to go to office hours early in the week to make sure you are on the right track with the homework, and then to go again later in the week to hammer out the details of the proofs. It will save you a lot of time because you won't waste time headed down the wrong path on the problems. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It is one of the most mind blowing courses you will ever take. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It is very hard, and they slam way to much material on you be careful 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It was very difficult and time intensive, but I thoroughly enjoyed the subject and feel as if I truly learned more than I have ever learned in one class. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's a good course, but it contains a lot of material and moves quite quickly. If you are anyway interested in computer theory or gaining experience with proof-based math classes, I would highly recommend taking it. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's a great class and you learn a lot but be prepared for a lot of work. Also make sure you take the class with Keith, he's a great instructor and teaches the content very effectively with fun pictures. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's a hard class if you're new to theoretical math... I definitely struggled with it! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's a lot of dense material taught at a very fast pace, and you need to be prepared to put the time in. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's a very difficult course that will take a lot of time, but you will learn more in it than almost any other course. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's hard. Really hard, but Keith is phenomenal and the course is super interesting. 10/10. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's interesting but also plenty of work. A lot of material, moves kind of quickly, but if you do the psets you'll be in good shape. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's really well taught so definitely don't miss lectures. The topic was new to me so everything was new and pretty interesting. It was difficult though getting used to an entirely different way of thinking than I was used to 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's tough, but worth it! 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
It's very fun and interesting. The course material is great, especially in the latter half of the class. However, it definitely gets much harder as the quarter goes on, and it's difficult sometimes to keep up. Go to Office Hours. Try not to fall behind early or else it'll be really hard to catch up later. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Its a lot of time and sets are very hard and grading is very picky 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
its fast. really fast. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keep up with lecture material. Take multiple sittings to do the problem sets so that you can develop a deeper understanding of the questions and work out your answers. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keep up with the lectures and don't fall behind. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keep up with the material, as you go 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keith is a great lecturer, so go to lecture to learn the material. Take advantage of the fact that you can work with 1-2 other people to discuss and complete problem sets. Keep an open mind - this is really cool material that many people haven't been exposed to before. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keith is a great teacher 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keith is an amazing lecturer who manages to frame theoretical computer science/math in a very applicable way. It's a lot of work though and grading can seem nitpicky. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keith is an amazing lecturer. The class is very intense, yet doable. I really learned a lot, though you should expect to put in a decent amount of time. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keith is an excellent lecturer. His enthusiasm for the material gets transmitted to the students. There are many, many resources freely available to help you do well in this class. The expectations class has of students, in terms of what you have to be able to learn, are very clear. 
(with Schwarz, Keith W, 2015/2016, Autumn)
Keith is awesome and I couldn't have asked for a better professor :)
