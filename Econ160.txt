Attend all lectures and go to office hours, as the p-sets are kind of impossible if you don't.

Be comfortable with basic probability and some basic calculus

Brett is a great professor who really engaged the audience and explained complex topics in an easy to understand way. His assignments are great for reinforcing class topics

Brett is awesome. He's super funny and makes coming to 2 hour lecture a choice you want to make. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
Brett Saraniti is hilarious! If he's teaching, and you're even remotely considering this class, take it! He keeps you engaged and hits all the important topics as well.

Brett was a good professor, material isn't hugely fascinating 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
Brett was a very chill professor and while psets do take awhile, the course overall was a good introduction to game theory

Fun course

Go to OH to finish PSets (they started out really long but eventually were cut down to a reasonable length.) Saraniti is interesting enough, but lecture sometimes strayed from the stuff that we had to do for psets and tests

homeworks graded harshly 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
I think that this is an interesting course, and the ideas taught are useful. However, it is a lot of technicality that bores it down and makes it more tedious than anything else often times. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
It is a great course. Difficult but relatively interesting things. Brett made the experience much better and lively. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
It is useful, problem sets take a very long time but are useful for midterm/final 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
Lectures don't prepare you well for psets. Be prepared to spend a ton of time on homework. Tests are tough as well. Overall, avoid if not a requirement.

never had a 2 hour long class this engaging. Professor is great!!! Homeworks take a long time. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
pretty tough, but a good elective to take 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
Problem sets are really tedious 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
Should be an easy class, it could be taught better though, but Brett is smart and a really funny guy. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
Stay on top of the psets 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
Take it! Game theory is practical and interesting. Pretty different from other Econ classes though. If you've taken Econ 136 and/or Econ 137, it does have some similarities to those classes. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
The notation for this material was very difficult to understand at first, but once you start to understand the basic definitions and models in the course, the material becomes much more interesting. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
This course is up and down. The grading was kind of tough and unfair, and Brett can be a pretty dry lecturer sometimes, but the situations he brings up and the interactive in-class games are really useful for learning and spice things up a bit. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is a very interesting course. Brett is an amazing (and hilarious) lecturer who is very animated and engaging. In lecture, we played several fun games that directly correlated to the course material. The problem sets, however, are harder than the material covered in class in my opinion, which made the class difficult. However, if you are comfortable with all those proofs and greek letters and whatnot, then by all means take the class! It was challenging yet fun! 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
This is quite a difficult class, and it has tons of notation that you need to get familiar with. A background in probability and econ can be very helpful, especially for the last few weeks of the course. The Problem Sets are pretty killer (10 hours a week). Go to office hours. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
We'll see if this class continues to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts of Stanford (which Prof. Saraniti joked about several times), but I hope it's not. Prof. Saraniti is very funny, and also knows his material very well. Lectures occasionally became hard to follow when it involved looking at slide after slide of equations, and it was more engaging when we worked through examples on the board. We also played a lot of fun games to test out some of the concepts we learned during class, which was fun and helped break up the lectures. 
(with Saraniti, Brett, 2017/2018, Winter)
You should absolutely take this class! Easily my favorite class here, the professor is engaging and insightful and the material is fascinating. I am not an economics major yet I felt like I came away with a strong understanding of the core concepts and I thoroughly enjoyed my time in lecture and working on problem sets.
