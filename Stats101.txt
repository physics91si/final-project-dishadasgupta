A bit of R, then a bit of stats, so you get exposure to both--both of which are necessary--but you don't really get a full grasp on either (quite impossible with only 8 weeks).

Be willing to push yourself because the programming language isn't the best documented.

Definitely take, awesome into into R for someone with limited datascience backgroung

dont take it, you will spend too much time coding, homework are very time consuming

I felt the class was not very well organized and it was impossible for me to do the homework without going to 80% of the OH. The homework and final were quite disconnected so after being studious the entire course, I still didn't feel ready to take the final in the end. I didn't enjoy the class and working on it every week was challenging and not fun.- that the homework questions are understandable - that the homework has a balance between using R and some theoretical questions (to get us ready for the final) - that the class doesn't advertise that you don't need prior coding or calculus background because it's very hard to understand without those 2 prerequisites

I think this is a really valuable class to take, and I learned a lot. The learning curve in R for the psets is quite steep, though.

I would not recommend taking this course at its current state. The course is not very organized and will take up the majority of your time outside of class. While it is interesting in theory, the course is not where it needs to be.

I'd definitely recommend this course to you if you are interested in data science. You'll get to work with some cool real-world data, and the course staff do put emphasize on the whole data analytics pipeline (getting the data into the write format, exploring it, and analyzing it). However, if you are interested in the prediction side of data science or machine learning, this is not the course for you. This, however, is not a limitation of this course and there are far more essential topics to discuss than there is time. I believe the mix of lectures were just right. Also, I think this course does not dive much into the data exploration aspect; you do learn how to visualize, summarize, etc. but sometimes it'd help to just explore the data set and extract insights (this was not extensive in this course).I think the recommended book is also a great addition to the course material, and it would be great to put further emphasize on it throughout the course. This may not be true for others, but I find it more interesting and exciting to first learn what I can do with (cleaned) data, and then learn how to actually import the data into R. I mean it'd make a lot of sense to ME to first teach some of the exploratory data analysis modules Visualization, and then dive into tidyverse and data imports. The fact that the course staff covered the data import and provided real world applications was super amazing and helpful. The inference module's lecture notes were not as clear as the other modules. I think this is an area where a little more emphasis and examples are needed. While I did enjoy all the examples in the course and I appreciate your hard effort on this, sometimes I felt too many biology-related examples were included which maybe a topic that some cannot relate to :) that being said, I understand the importance of examples in this exciting area. Maybe adding a little bit of variety to the examples can be more effective. This was not a problem, but at certain times I felt this was a little bit of an issue for me. Thanks to all of you for this amazing and most-needed course; I sure am looking forward to future versions of this class.

Provides a great introduction into statistics with a data science spin. Highly recommend if you have any interested in data science at all. 
(with Johndrow, James; Sabatti, Chiara, 2016/2017, Spring)
The class claims that it is an introductory course with no statistical background required, but I would recommend having it coming in for the instructors teach as if it is a simple review. In addition, unless you want to spend hours on problem sets, I recommend knowing how to use R. Not as advertised.Make sure your teaching assistants actually understand the problem sets you write up - nothing is more frustrating than going to section and having to struggle with the TA who does not even truly understand what you all are asking us to do. Definitely need more formal instruction of R itself - half of the time spent on problem sets was figuring out syntax, rather than conceptually understanding what is going on. There is also little help given from the teaching staff...vague email responses, rude responses, and no useful resources (such as answers to practice exams).

This class is new, so it will probably change in the future. When I took it, it was a little disorganized. What was expected in the problems sets were not covered in lecture. 
(with Johndrow, James; Sabatti, Chiara, 2016/2017, Spring)
This course is helpful if you want a basic understanding of how to use R, not very helpful for learning basic statistics. It's pretty unorganized and the problem sets are not at all related to the final exam. The problem sets can take longer than expected; don't rely on this to be a super chill class-- it's not that stressful but it is time-consuming to figure out how to get the functions in R to work.Don't have the class at 9:30am five days per week! It is so unnecessary. Most lectures weren't particularly relevant to doing the problem sets, and then the final exam was completely different than the problem sets so I actually had to learn statistics in the few days before. Would be more helpful to have more conceptual problems in the psets so that I actually have a reason to pay attention in lecture and learn the underlying concepts instead of just how to perform functions in R. Also really frustrating that we had had no practice with the final exam format questions before the final; I had no idea what was expected of me when a question would ask me to "Comment" or to "Explain." Incredibly frustrating also that no solutions were published for the final exam practice problems, and that the TAs didn't even really have clear answers to a lot of them. Many of the problem sets also felt tedious, and required long hours of googling how to do things in R that didnâ€™t feel very productive.

You will get out what you put it. It's possible to answer the problem set questions without a whole lot of effort, but then you don't learn the concepts as well.
