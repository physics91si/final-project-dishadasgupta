Avoid taking it with Prof Crimmins if you can, because the topics and readings were super interesting, although very dense, but the lectures were extremely dry and I never felt like the topics and arguments in the papers were clearly explained. It was extremely boring and I never knew where he was in his notes because there were no slides, and very minimal words he'd write on the chalkboard.

Balances breadth and depth in topics of philosophy of mind really well and helps you improve your writing skills extremely quickly. Really great experience 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Choose a topic the class will cover and study it intensely. The last two papers of the class will be much easier if this approach is take. The material covered in the last half of the class almost has no bearing on the grade. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Definitely take it. It's worth taking for people of any background. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Didn't enjoy this class, but perhaps it will be improved in the future! 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Do not fall behind on readings, they are important to understand course content. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Do not take it with Crimmins. Do not take it with Crimmins. I repeat: do not take it with Crimmins. One of the worst professors I've had, and I've had some bad ones. Every single class was just a 90-minute long regurgitation, essentially verbatim, of the main points of the assigned papers; this was helpful to the extent that some papers were dense, but there was never anything else. I don't think Crimmins mentioned a single thought of his own about any paper throughout the entire course. In addition, he's not a great public speaker; a lot of uhs/ums and he speaks very quietly, so it can be hard to hear in a large auditorium. He's a good guy and I'm sure he knows his stuff, but my recommendation would be to take it with Donaldson or at least a more charismatic, talented professor. This is the sort of subject that a good/bad professor can make or break. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
don't 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Great class! Very interesting and engaging topics and the paper topics are very open-ended so you can write about whatever topic interests you. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Great class. The material is dry which reflects on Crimmins but still worth it. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I guess you have to take it if you're Symsys. Lectures are boring and he drones on -- most people are on Facebook. The reading reactions are really annoying bitchwork that you have to bs on the readings. The TAs are nice, and want to help; and Mark isn't a bad person, just a bad lecturer. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
I thought Prof. Crimmins was a boring lecturer, but sections were valuable and helped me a lot to actually understand the material we were covering. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
If Professor Crimmins teaches it, focus on getting the gist of each reading and flesh out all the concepts you'd need for your papers in section/office hours. That's all you need to succeed. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It seems like a pretty standard phil class. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a good intro to philosophy of mind and gets you in the right headspace to write philosophy papers, which are different from other humanities papers 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's a lot of reading, but the topics are actually quite interesting. Writing 2 reflection each week can be cumbersome, but it keeps you on top of the readings, so it's kind of a good part of the class. Also, really pay attention when Crimmins speaks in lecture; sometimes, it's easy to zone out in philosophy classes, but he actually does a great job of making philosophy super clear. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
It's required, so buckle up. Lectures were difficult to follow. No slides, no transparency or reiteration of major points... difficulty understanding material in this environment. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Keep on top of the readings. Section is very helpful but lecture is not 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
lecture a little boring, but pretty interesting overall 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Lectures can sometimes be confusing or seem ramble-y. It can be difficult to take organized notes. Do your best to stay awake and pay attention to when Prof Crimmins is talking about a main argument vs objections vs replies to those objections. Ask questions when you are unconvinced. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Lol the first drafts are brutal. Or maybe that was just my TA, idk. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Make sure to do the readings, they are very interesting and you learn so much! 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Professor Crimmins' lectures are not too structured, begin mainly extended discussion and context-providing about the assigned text. This means that reading the assigned texts are crucial! But if you do so, you can get a lot out of lecture. Having prior classes in philosophy is not really a requirement if you are confident in your critical thinking skills. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Some readings are pretty abstract and don't make sense if you have differing fundamental tenets 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it - but be wary that lectures can be hard if the room is warm. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Take it early in your Stanford career 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Talk to your TA! They're very helpful and a big part of philosophy is bouncing your ideas off of other people. I got so much useful feedback for my paper by going to office hours. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The course is tough 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The lectures are usually pretty boring, but the discussion section is very interesting and helpful. If you don't understand the readings, it is best to go to office hours rather than lecture. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
The lectures aren't particularly stimulating, but if you have a good TA then you can get a lot out of the readings because its a very well cultivated syllabus. Sometimes you just have to do more self-directed learning in order to prepare for the essays. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
There is a lot of content and very little help engaging with it. Lectures are simply not engaging and are very difficult to follow. Prof. Crimmins seems to be extremely intelligent but because of this does not seem to be able to teach to the level of the students. If you truly want to learn the content, I suggest doing the readings to the best of your ability and then going to discuss them with a TA during office hours because lecture provides no support in actually understanding the material. Additionally, make sure you go to office hours to discuss your papers as much as possible. The prompts are really terribly written and often the learning they want you to display in your writing is not clear from the prompts. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
There will be a lot of readings and hard but interesting material. Find a good TA who will help you with your writing skills. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This class was quite challenging, but was one of my favorite courses at Stanford. The readings and concepts certainly take time to really understand and grasp, but the professor and TAs help explain the material, and the topics are fascinating to engage with in meaningful discussion and writing. Having taken mostly STEM classes thus far, I found this class a refreshing opportunity to use my mind in new ways and think about reality from new perspectives. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This course will help your philosophy writing and analytical thinking a lot. Having to write three papers that cover some fairly difficult topics will really push you to think and develop clear and rigorous arguments. The material itself can get a little bit confusing and the lectures can seem long and complicated at times. Your enjoyment of the material will probably depend on if you like thinking about philosophy of mind issues to begin with. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This is not a class one should take to "test out" whether or not one is interested in Philosophy. Wait to take Phil 80 under you're sure that you want to major. There are structural problems to Phil 80 that I'm not sure are persistent across different quarters or particular to how Crimmins organizes the class. I think the class would greatly benefit from more historical context about how the shape of the debates under analysis have changed. I frequently felt as though I were jumping into a very specific debate where a paper was responding to a specific other paper without having the context to evaluate what the stakes were and how to follow. I understand that assigning SEP entries are likely meant to offer this context, but they offer a summary of a topic rather than a sense how ideas evolved from one to the next. I think the class would hold together a lot better if we had this kind of framing for the readings. Specific to the course as taught by Crimmins: Lectures were often difficult to follow for me. I found it essential to sit in the first few rows to remain engaged. Crimmins is exceptionally smart and thorough in his argumentation. He treats all questions with an earnest attention and brings out their best points. However, this thoroughness also. I think, makes it hard to distinguish between the important points of the lecture. I had a very difficult time following which problems were most significant and often felt that a question necessitating a 30 second answer was given 10 minutes. Everything that Crimmins says is smart, right, and clear. However, there is a disconnect for me that makes it difficult to follow and remain engaged. I'm not sure where in the process this happens. Perhaps it is because I don't have a sense of which points are key or where the conversation is going. It's pretty special to have a course that requires second drafts -- take advantage of it and you'll get a lot out of the course. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
This was a cool intro to central topics in philosophy of mind and language, and definitely helped me with writing philosophy papers. Crimmins can be a dull lecturer, so I'd say focus on getting a good TA for section. The reading and paper loads can be overwhelming, but just try to spread them out and manage your time well. I recommend going to your TA's office hours frequently especially for help with argument construction for papers. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Very dry. Not a lot of structure to lectures. Make sure to drink some coffee beforehand if you want to stay focused 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Very hard concepts for an introductory class.Lots of writing. Dry lectures. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Very important class for the major as a whole. Interesting and engaging class that allows great insight into the field of philosophy and the important concepts thereof. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Very interesting topics. Crimmins can be a little windy in class but if you ask him questions you'll learn a lot. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
very knowledgeable professor even though the content is very dense at times. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
what you make it! 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
You get out of this class as much as you put into it. The readings are very interesting and engaging and the overall content is thought provoking. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
You will learn a lot of philosophy of mind although a lot of concept may not stick in the moment. You will be to exposed to many school of though related to PoM. It is overall a very interesting course. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2017/2018, Autumn)
Don't take it unless you have to or unless you're really interested in philosophy of mind. Quality of instruction varies widely by quarter, and neither the Phil nor SymSys departments seem to care very much about making this course good. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Expect intense turnaround in editing papers and turning in rough/final drafts one week apart. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Give it your best shot. Philosophy papers are more about the soundness of your argument that English papers. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I recommend it. It's a good philosophy course with a pretty universally interesting topics. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I would only take this if required for a major. I found the lectures less than amazing, and it was a fairly significant amount of work for the benefit. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I would recommend against taking this course if you're interested in philosophy. It's mostly symsys people. The material is interesting, but you will learn more if you just take metaphysics and philosophy of mind/language separately. You'll have to take it eventually if you're a major, but I wouldn't worry about taking it too soon because you'll probably learn as much if not more about writing and philosophy by taking other philosophy classes. Most lectures summarized readings, and it would've been nice if the course had focused more on analysis and less reading comprehension. I really don't think this class should be required for symbolic systems or philosophy because the symbolic systems students seem thoroughly uninterested in the material or very interested in a few narrow topics ("Do computers have feelings/souls?") that (in my relatively biased view) prevent any meaningful philosophical discussion from getting off the ground. The symsys/philosophy mix has a really deleterious effect on the quality of our learning. For example, there was a student in my section who would do CS 103 homework in the middle of our discussions, look up, say something that derailed the conversation, and then continue his problem set without listening to anyone. Another example: at least four of the roughly eight people in our section seemed to think entirely in analogies with computers (this is kind of like machine code, this is kind of like a processor, this is kind of like binary, etc.), which can be interesting, but has really obvious limits if that becomes the only (or even the most common) way we tend to look at things. My writing improved, but I think it would've improved the same amount, maybe more, if I had taken practically any other philosophy class. In short, I don't feel like we actually learned a lot of philosophy, and I don't feel like we actually learned enough about writing to justify the time that was spent on this course. Maybe it should just be WIM for symsys because that's kind of the role it's playing right now. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
I would say definitely take this class with Crimmins. He has a good grasp of the material and walks you through papers that you only kind of understand the first time. I find his lecture style to be straightforward and informative, and I thought he was funny. The material seems to be essential to thinking about our own existence and the universe. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
It is interesting material, but the class is not very well structured 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Lectures aren't interesting 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Make sure to always be caught up in the class because everything is related to everything else in this class. Also start early on the papers. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Plan your essays early, as that will be the bulk of what you learn. There is a lot of dense reading which is important to keep up on, but it can be a lot to handle at once so make sure to stay focused on the material that directly applies to your essays. Start early so you can get help from your TA, which is ultimately where you learn everything from, rather than the course material which seems unrelated at times 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Read and go to lecture 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
take it 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take it if you either need to or are deeply interested in questions of philosophy of mind. Otherwise, there isn't much reason to take it. The readings are often challenging and involved, so you need to genuinely enjoy the content to want to do them. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Take time to think through the papers before you write them, and to revise or even reverse your position on an issue. Don't defend a thesis you're no longer convinced is true. Also definitely ask for help understanding, because the readings are often difficult to parse. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
This is a great course to establish a firm foundation in philosophy of mind and develop skills that will pay dividends down the line. 
(with Crimmins, Mark, 2016/2017, Autumn)
Yes, it's a lot of writing (which stresses the heck out of me), but it can and was really interesting if you get into it. Dave Gottlieb is a superstar TA, and Mark Crimmins has an awesome philosopher's voice. If you set aside time to really engage with the readings, as I often failed to do, there are some really brilliant ideas other bits to learn from in the subtleties and details of the arguments and writing.
